V723 Mon is a nearby ($d\\sim460\\,\\rm pc$), bright\n($V\\simeq8.3$~mag), evolved ($T_{\\rm eff, giant}\\simeq4440$ K, $L_{\\rm\ngiant}\\simeq173~L_\\odot$ and $R_{\\rm giant}\\simeq22 ~R_\\odot$) red giant in a\nhigh mass function, $f(M)=1.72\\pm 0.01~M_\\odot$, nearly circular binary\n($P=59.9$ d, $e\\simeq 0$). V723 Mon is a known variable star, previously\nclassified as an eclipsing binary, but its ASAS, KELT, and TESS light curves\nare those of a nearly edge-on ellipsoidal variable. Detailed models of the\nlight curves constrained by the period, radial velocities and stellar\ntemperature give an inclination of $i=87.0^\\circ \\pm 1.0^\\circ$, a mass ratio\nof $q\\simeq0.30\\pm0.02$, a companion mass of $M_{\\rm\ncomp}=2.91\\pm0.08~M_\\odot$, a stellar radius of $R_{\\rm\ngiant}=23.6\\pm1.0~R_\\odot$, and a giant mass of $M_{\\rm giant}=0.87\\pm0.08~\nM_\\odot$. We identify a likely non-stellar, diffuse veiling component with\ncontributions in the $B$ and $V$-band of ${\\sim}64\\%$ and ${\\sim}23\\%$,\nrespectively. The SED and the absence of continuum eclipses imply that the\ncompanion mass must be dominated by a compact object. We do observe eclipses of\nthe Balmer lines when the dark companion passes behind the giant, but their\nvelocity spreads are low compared to observed accretion disks. The X-ray\nluminosity of the system is $L_{\\rm X}\\simeq1.0\\times10^{30}~\\rm ergs~s^{-1}$,\ncorresponding to $L\/L_{\\rm edd}{\\sim}10^{-9}$.The simplest explanation for the\nmassive companion is a single compact object, most likely a black hole in the\n\"mass gap\", although a double neutron star binary is possible.\n"

While initially used in cosmological tests to assess the\ncompatibility with $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology of such a massive virialized object\nat this redshift, more recent studies indicate SPT-CL J2106-5844 is undergoing\na major merger, and is not an isolated system with a singular, well-defined\nhalo. We use sensitive, high spatial resolution measurements from ALMA and ACA\nof the thermal SZ effect to reconstruct the pressure distribution of the\nintracluster medium in this system. These measurements are coupled with radio\nobservations from the EMU pilot survey, using ASKAP and the ATCA to search for\ndiffuse non-thermal emission. Further, to better constrain the thermodynamic\nstructure of the cluster, we complement our analysis with re-processed archival\n$Chandra$ observations. We fit the ALMA+ACA SZ data in $uv$-space using a\nBayesian forward modelling technique. The ASKAP and ATCA data are processed and\nimaged to specifically highlight any potential diffuse radio emission. In the\nALMA+ACA SZ data, we reliably identify at high significance two main gas\ncomponents associated with the mass clumps inferred from weak lensing. Our\nstatistical test excludes at the ~9.9$\\sigma$ level the possibility of\ndescribing the system with a single SZ component. While the components had been\nmore difficult to identify in the X-ray data alone, we find that the bimodal\ngas distribution is supported by X-ray hardness distribution. The EMU radio\nobservations reveal a diffuse radio structure ~400 kpc in projected extent\nalong the north-west\/south-east direction, indicative of strong activity from\nthe active galactic nucleus within the brightest cluster galaxy. Interestingly,\nalbeit on a smaller scale, a putative optical star-forming filamentary\nstructure detected in the HST image is in an excellent alignment with the radio\nstructure.\n"

      "abstract": "Recent observations of globular clusters (GCs) provide evidence that the\nstellar initial mass function (IMF) may not be universal, suggesting\nspecifically that the IMF grows increasingly top-heavy with decreasing\nmetallicity and increasing gas density. Non-canonical IMFs can greatly affect\nthe evolution of GCs, mainly because the high end determines how many black\nholes (BHs) form. Here we compute a new set of GC models, varying the IMF\nwithin observational uncertainties. We find that GCs with top-heavy IMFs lose\nmost of their mass within a few Gyr through stellar winds and tidal stripping.\nHeating of the cluster through BH mass segregation greatly enhances this\nprocess. We show that, as they approach complete dissolution, GCs with\ntop-heavy IMFs can evolve into 'dark clusters' consisting of mostly BHs by\nmass. In addition to producing more BHs, GCs with top-heavy IMFs also produce\nmany more binary BH (BBH) mergers. Even though these clusters are short-lived,\nmergers of ejected BBHs continue at a rate comparable to, or greater than, what\nis found for long-lived GCs with canonical IMFs. Therefore these clusters,\nalthough they are no longer visible today, could still contribute significantly\nto the local BBH merger rate detectable by LIGO\/Virgo, especially for sources\nwith higher component masses well into the BH mass gap. We also report that one\nof our GC models with a top-heavy IMF produces dozens of intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) with masses $M>100\\,{\\rm M_\\odot}$, including one with\n$M>500\\,{\\rm M_\\odot}$. Ultimately, additional gravitational wave observations\nwill provide strong constraints on the stellar IMF in old GCs and the formation\nof IMBHs at high redshift.\n"

Overall, DF44 does not have internal\nproperties similar to other dwarf galaxies and is inconsistent with it having\nbeen puffed up through a prolonged, bursty star-formation history, as suggested\nby some simulations.

However, the long-term, continuous, high-precision\nmonitoring data to test this hypothesis for more objects is lacking. By\napplying our novel photometric approach to TESS data, we extract a\nhigh-precision lightcurve of the closest brown dwarfs, which form the binary\nsystem Luhman 16AB. Our observations, that cover about 100 rotations of Luhman\n16B, display continuous lightcurve evolution. The periodogram analysis shows\nthat the rotational period of the component that dominates the lightcurve is\n5.28 h. We also find evidence for periods of 2.5 h, 6.94 h, and 90.8 h. We show\nthat the 2.5 h and 5.28 h periods emerge from Luhman 16B and that they consist\nof multiple, slightly shifted peaks, revealing the presence of high-speed jets\nand zonal circulation in this object. We find that the lightcurve evolution is\nwell fit by the planetary-scale waves model, further supporting this\ninterpretation. We argue that the 6.94 h peak is likely the rotation period of\nLuhman 16A. By comparing the rotational periods to observed v sin(i)\nmeasurements, we show that the two brown dwarfs are viewed at angles close to\ntheir equatorial planes. We also describe a long-period (P~91 h) evolution in\nthe lightcurve, which we propose emerges from the vortex-dominated polar\nregions.

It was\nselected from ROSAT data in the 10,000 square degrees of overlap with BOSS,\nmapping a total number of 2770 high-z galaxy clusters. We present here the full\nresults of the CFHT CODEX program on cluster mass measurement, including a\nreanalysis of CFHTLS Wide data, with 25 individual lensing-constrained cluster\nmasses. We employ $lensfit$ shape measurement and perform a conservative\ncolour-space selection and weighting of background galaxies. Using the\ncombination of shape noise and an analytic covariance for intrinsic variations\nof cluster profiles at fixed mass due to large scale structure, miscentring,\nand variations in concentration and ellipticity, we determine the likelihood of\nthe observed shear signal as a function of true mass for each cluster. We\ncombine 25 individual cluster mass likelihoods in a Bayesian hierarchical\nscheme with the inclusion of optical and X-ray selection functions to derive\nconstraints on the slope $\\alpha$, normalization $\\beta$, and scatter\n$\\sigma_{\\ln \\lambda | \\mu}$ of our richness-mass scaling relation model in\nlog-space: $\\left<\\ln \\lambda | \\mu \\right> = \\alpha \\mu + \\beta$, with $\\mu =\n\\ln (M_{200c}\/M_{\\mathrm{piv}})$, and $M_{\\mathrm{piv}} = 10^{14.81}\nM_{\\odot}$.

In these events, the returning tidal debris\nstream drills through the pre-existing AGN accretion disk near the stream\npericenter, destroying the inner disk in the process, and then intersects with\nthe disk a second time at radii ranging from a few to hundreds of times the\npericenter distance. The debris dynamics of such TDEs, and hence their\nappearance, are distinct from ordinary TDEs. Here we explore the signature of\nthis \"second impact\" of the stream with the disk. Strong shocks form as the\ndilute stream is stopped by the denser disk. Compton cooling of the shocked\nmaterial produces hard X-rays, even soft gamma-rays, with most of the energy\nemitted between ~10 keV and 1 MeV. The luminosity follows the mass-return rate,\npeaking between ~$10^{42}$ and $10^{44}$ erg\/s. The X-ray hardness and the\nsmoothness of the light curve provide possible means for distinguishing the\nsecond impact from ordinary AGN flares, which exhibit softer spectra and more\nirregular light curves.\n"

      "abstract": "Using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we\ninvestigate the formation of multiple stellar populations (MSPs) in globular\nclusters (GCs) within the context of their parent galaxies. In our scenario,\nthe second generation (2G) of stars originate from both asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) polluters and pristine gas accreted from the host galaxy. Previous\ntheoretical and numerical studies have demonstrated that this 'AGB with\ndilution' model has the potential to alleviate several problems faced by the\nclassical AGB scenario. However, the accretion of pristine gas on to the GC has\nyet to be investigated within the context of the parent galaxy. This paper\npresents the preliminary results from our original simulation code which models\nGC formation from giant molecular clouds in a host galaxy, and subsequent gas\naccretion on to the GC. By simulating the genesis of the 2G over a 370 Myr time\nframe, we demonstrate that the fraction of 2G stars are inextricably linked to\nthe GC's environment. Our simulations rationalize the wide variety of abundance\npatterns, kinematics, and 2G concentrations by altering the initial conditions\nof both the GC progenitor and the host galaxy itself. Most notably, we\nreproduce a positive correlation between the fraction of 2G stars and the\ninitial mass of the cluster. We discuss the physical implications of our\nscenario and compare our simulations with observations of the Galactic GC 47\nTucanae (47 Tuc). Finally, we present scaling relations that encompass the\nwider GC population and serve as a reference for future observations.\n"

The energy difference between the lowest ortho and para states is as\nlarge as 14.7 meV, corresponding to ~170 K. Therefore, each state of H2\ndifferently affects not only the chemistry but also the macroscopic gas\ndynamics in space, and thus, the ortho-to-para abundance ratio (OPR) of H2 has\nsignificant impacts on various astronomical phenomena. For a long time, the OPR\nof nascent H2 upon formation on dust grains has been assumed to have a\nstatistical value of three and to gradually equilibrate in the gas phase at the\ntemperature of the circumstances. Recently, NSC of H2 was experimentally\nrevealed to occur on water ice at very low temperatures and thus incorporated\ninto gas-dust chemical models. However, H2 molecules should form well before\ndust grains are coated by water ice. Information about how the OPR of H2\nbehaves on bare silicate dust before ice-mantle formation is lacking. Knowing\nthe influence of the OPR of H2 if the OPR changes even on a bare silicate\nsurface within an astronomically meaningful time scale is desirable. We report\nthe first laboratory measurements of NSC of H2 physisorbed on amorphous\nsilicate (Mg2SiO4) at temperatures up to 18 K. The conversion was found to\noccur very rapidly.\n"

      "abstract": "The properties of interstellar grains, such as grain size distribution and\ngrain porosity, are affected by interstellar processing, in particular,\ncoagulation and shattering, which take place in the dense and diffuse\ninterstellar medium (ISM), respectively. In this paper, we formulate and\ncalculate the evolution of grain size distribution and grain porosity through\nshattering and coagulation. For coagulation, we treat the grain evolution\ndepending on the collision energy. Shattering is treated as a mechanism of\nforming small compact fragments. The balance between these processes are\ndetermined by the dense-gas mass fraction $\\eta_\\mathrm{dense}$, which\ndetermines the time fraction of coagulation relative to shattering. We find\nthat the interplay between shattering supplying small grains and coagulation\nforming porous grains from shattered grains is fundamentally important in\ncreating and maintaining porosity. The porosity rises to 0.7--0.9 (or the\nfilling factor 0.3--0.1) around grain radii $a\\sim 0.1~\\mu$m. We also find\nthat, in the case of $\\eta_\\mathrm{dense}=0.1$ (very efficient shattering with\nweak coagulation) porosity significantly enhances coagulation, creating fluffy\nsubmicron grains with filling factors lower than 0.1. The porosity enhances the\nextinction by 10--20 per cent at all wavelengths for amorphous carbon and at\nultraviolet wavelengths for silicate. The extinction curve shape of silicate\nbecomes steeper if we take porosity into account. We conclude that the\ninterplay between shattering and coagulation is essential in creating porous\ngrains in the interstellar medium and that the resulting porosity can impact\nthe grain size distributions and extinction curves.\n"

This source\nilluminates the accretion disk and gives rise to the discrete (lines) and\ncontinuum-reflected components. The main goal of this work is to investigate\nwhether the extended, mildly relativistic jet that is present in black hole\nbinaries in the hard and hard-intermediate states is the hard X-ray source that\nilluminates the accretion disk. We use a Monte Carlo code that simulates the\nprocess of inverse Compton scattering in a mildly relativistic jet. Blackbody\nphotons from the thin accretion disk are injected at the base of the jet and\ninteract with the energetic electrons that move outward. Despite the fact that\nthe jet moves away from the disk at a mildly relativistic speed, we find that\napproximately $15-20$\\% of the input soft photons are scattered back toward the\naccretion disk. The vast majority of the Comptonized, back-scattered photons\nescape very close to the black hole ($h\\lesssim 6 r_g$, where $r_g$ is the\ngravitational radius), but a non-negligible amount escape at a wide range of\nheights. At high heights, $h\\sim 500-2000\\,r_g$, the distribution falls off\nrapidly. The high-height cutoff strongly depends on the width of the jet at its\nbase and is almost insensitive to the optical depth. The disk illumination\nspectrum is softer than the direct jet spectrum of the radiation that escapes\nin directions that do not encounter the disk. We conclude that an extended jet\nis an excellent candidate source of hard photons in reflection models.\n"

In this paper we present a new standalone tool, makemap,\nthat estimates the fitted velocity at each pixel from Gauss-Hermite fits to a\n3D spectral data cube, together with its uncertainty obtained from a modified\nbootstrap procedure. We apply this new tool to neutral hydrogen spectra for 18\ngalaxies from the THINGS sample, and present new velocity maps with\nuncertainties. We propagate the estimated uncertainties in the velocity map\ninto our previously-described model fitting tool DiskFit to derive new rotation\ncurves. The uncertainties we obtain from these fits take into account not only\nthe observational errors, but also uncertainties in the fitted systemic\nvelocity, position of the rotation centre, inclination of the galaxy to the\nline of sight, and forced non-circular motion. They are therefore much\nbetter-defined than values that have previously been available. Our estimated\nuncertainties on the circular speeds differ from previous estimates by factors\nranging up to of five, being smaller in some cases and larger in others. We\nconclude that kinematic models of well-resolved HI datasets vary widely in\ntheir precision and reliability, and therefore potentially in their value for\ncomparisons with predictions from cosmological galaxy formation simulations.\n"

We compare two radiation environments,\nnamely the L1 and L2 Lagrangian points, and derive indications against the\nlatter. We estimate the particle-induced background level on the X-IFU\nmicrocalorimeter with Monte Carlo simulations, before and after all the\nsolutions adopted to reduce its level. Concerning the GCR induced component the\nbackground level is compliant with the mission requirement. Regarding the Soft\nProtons component, the analysis does not predict dramatically different\nbackgrounds in the L1 and L2 orbits. However, the lack of data concerning the\nL2 environment labels it as very weakly characterizable, and thus we advise\nagainst its choice as orbit for X-ray missions. We then use these background\nlevels to simulate the observation of a typical galaxy cluster from its center\nout to 1.2 R200 to probe the characterization capabilities of the instrument\nout to the outskirts.

To demonstrate our method, we use the\nspectra of 13 quasars and one GRB with DLA absorbers detected along their\nsightlines. By using the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation, which relates the\nwavelength-integrated extinction to the total volume occupied by dust per\nhydrogen nucleon, we set some robust lower limits on the metallicity of the\nDLAs. The resulting lower limits are all consistent with the DLA metallicities\nfrom the literature. The GRB extinction curve exhibits a very strong 2175 A\nextinction bump. We try to constrain the metallicity of the GRB DLA by modeling\nthe GRB extinction curve using dust models with two (graphite and silicates)\nand three (PAH, hydrogenated amorphous carbon, and silicates) dust components.\nThe two-component model resulted in a metallicity of $Z\\sim$$-$0.45 while the\nthree-component model gives $Z\\sim$$-$0.50. On the other hand, the lower limit\nfrom the KK approach for this DLA is $Z\\ge$$-$0.60. Modeling a large sample of\nextinction curves with 2175 A extinction bump and measured DLA metallicities\nwould allow a thorough comparison between the KK and the model-dependent\napproach. In cases where the precise measurement of the metallicity of a DLA is\nnot possible (e.g. due to the saturation of important absorption lines), the\napproach presented in this paper can be used to constrain the metallicity.\n"

The occurrences of solar maxima show almost no Hale cycle\ndependence, confirming that the clock is synchronized to polarity reversals.\nThe odd cycle minima lead the even cycle minima by ~ 1.1 normalized years,\nwhereas the odd cycle terminators (McIntosh et al.

It resolves an extended late declining phase which is\napproximately twice as long on even Schwabe cycles as odd. Galactic Cosmic Ray\nflux rises in step with <acv(27)> but then stays high.

Such coatings play an important role in\nenhancing the reflectivity of X-ray mirrors by allowing reflections at angles\nmuch larger than the critical angle of X-ray reflection for the given\nmaterials. Coating with an equal thickness of each bilayer enhances the\nreflectivity at discrete energies, satisfying Bragg condition. However, by\nsystematically varying the bilayer thickness in the multilayer stack, it is\npossible to design X-ray mirrors having enhanced reflectivity over a broad\nenergy range. One of the most important applications of such a depth graded\nmultilayer mirror is to realize hard X-ray telescopes for astronomical\npurposes. Design of such multilayer X-ray mirrors and their characterization\nwith X-ray reflectivity measurements require appropriate software tools. We\nhave initiated the development of hard X-ray optics for future Indian X-ray\nastronomical missions, and in this context, we have developed a program,\nDarpanX, to calculate X-ray reflectivity for single and multilayer mirrors. It\ncan be used as a stand-alone tool for designing multilayer mirrors with\nrequired characteristics. But more importantly, it has been implemented as a\nlocal model for the popular X-ray spectral fitting program, XSPEC, and thus can\nbe used for accurate fitting of the experimentally measured X-ray reflectivity\ndata. DarpanX is implemented as a Python 3 module, and an API is provided to\naccess the underlying algorithms. Here we present details of DarpanX\nimplementation and its validation for different type multilayer structures.

Given their upper level energies of 225 K, they were thought\nto arise in dense, hot molecular cores near newly formed stars. However, this\nhas not been confirmed by further observations of these lines and their origin\nhas remained unclear. Generally, there is a scarcity of observational data for\nCH2 and, while it is an important compound in the astrochemical context, its\nactual occurrence in astronomical sources is poorly constrained. The present\nstudy, along with other recent observations of the Orion region we report, rule\nout the possibility of an association with gas that is both hot and dense. We\nfind that the distribution of the CH2 emission closely follows that of the\n[CII] 158 um emission, while CH2 is undetected toward the hot core itself. The\nobservations suggest, rather, that its extended emission arises from hot but\ndilute layers of PDRs and not from the denser parts of such regions as in the\ncase of the Orion Bar. This hypothesis was corroborated by comparisons of the\nobserved CH2 line profiles with those of CRRLs, well-known PDR tracers. In\naddition, we report the detection of the 70 GHz fine- and hfs lines of o-CH2\ntoward the W51E, W51M, W51N, W49N, W43, W75N, DR21, and S140 SFRs, and three of\nthe fine- and hfs lines between 68-71 GHz toward W3 IRS5. Furthermore, using a\nnon-LTE radiative transfer analysis, we can constrain the gas temperatures and\nH2 density to 163 K and 3.4e3 cm^-3, respectively. This analysis confirms our\nhypothesis that CH2 originates in warm and dilute PDR layers. Our analysis\nsuggests that for the excitation conditions under the physical conditions that\nprevail in such regions, these lines are masering, with weak level inversion.\nThe resulting amplification of the lines' spontaneous emission greatly aids in\ntheir detection.\n"

The digital\noutput of the entire detector consistently yielded energy resolutionsthat\nexceeded 100% for different sources. The analog output of the monolithic\nsilicon pixels indicates that thisis a promising technology for future\ngamma-ray missions, while the analysis of the digital output points to theneed\nfor a redesign of future photon-sensitive monolithic silicon pixel detectors.\n"

      "abstract": "Radio interferometer arrays such as HERA consist of many close-packed dishes\narranged in a regular pattern, giving rise to a large number of `redundant'\nbaselines with the same length and orientation. Since identical baselines\nshould see an identical sky signal, this provides a way of finding a relative\ngain\/bandpass calibration without needing an explicit sky model. In reality,\nthere are many reasons why baselines will not be exactly identical, giving rise\nto a host of effects that spoil the redundancy of the array and induce spurious\nstructure in the calibration solutions if not accounted for. In this paper, we\nperform a wide range of simulations for a small HERA-like array to understand\nhow different types of non-redundancy manifest in the observed interferometric\nvisibilities and their resulting frequency (delay-space) power spectra. We\nfocus in particular on differences in the primary beam response between\nantennas, including variations in the main lobe, sidelobes, ellipticity, and\norientation. We find that different types of non-redundancy impart\ncharacteristic patterns into the redundant gain solutions, which in turn\nintroduce additional structure into the calibrated visibilities and therefore\nthe delay spectra. We show that the most severe effects of primary beam\nnon-redundancy are induced by the brightest sources passing through the beam,\nwhile diffuse emission has a lesser (but non-negligible) effect. We also find\nthat redundant baseline groups with `outlier' antennas (where only one antenna\ndeviates from perfect redundancy) sustain the largest gain errors, while even\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ non-redundancies in the sidelobes seem to have a relatively\nminor impact in comparison.\n"

      "abstract": "In the standard Lambda cold dark matter paradigm, pure dark matter\nsimulations predict dwarf galaxies should inhabit dark matter haloes with a\ncentrally diverging density `cusp'. This is in conflict with observations that\ntypically favour a constant density `core'. We investigate this `cusp-core\nproblem' in `ultra-faint' dwarf galaxies simulated as part of the `Engineering\nDwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge' (EDGE) project. We find, similarly to\nprevious work, that gravitational potential fluctuations within the central\nregion of the simulated dwarfs kinematically heat the dark matter particles,\nlowering the dwarfs' central dark matter density. However, these fluctuations\nare not exclusively caused by gas inflow\/outflow, but also by impulsive heating\nfrom minor mergers. We use the genetic modification approach on one of our\ndwarf's initial conditions to show how a delayed assembly history leads to more\nlate minor mergers and, correspondingly, more dark matter heating. This\nprovides a mechanism by which even ultra-faint dwarfs ($M_* <\n10^5\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), in which star formation was fully quenched at high\nredshift, can have their central dark matter density lowered over time. In\ncontrast, we find that late major mergers can regenerate a central dark matter\ncusp, if the merging galaxy had sufficiently little star formation. The\ncombination of these effects leads us to predict significant stochasticity in\nthe central dark matter density slopes of the smallest dwarfs, driven by their\nunique star formation and mass assembly histories.\n"

If the source is a disk galaxy with a well-ordered velocity field,\nhowever, velocity field data can support simultaneous inference of the shear,\ninclination, and position angle, virtually eliminating shape noise. We use the\nFisher Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in\nthe idealized case of a perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an\ninfinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets one shear component,\n$\\gamma_\\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\\frac{90}{I_0}\\frac{25}{n_{\\rm\npix}}$ where $I_0$ is the S\/N of the central intensity pixel and $n_{\\rm pix}$\nis the number of pixels across a diameter enclosing 80\\% of the light. This\nprecision degrades with inclination angle, by a factor of three by\n$i{=}50^\\circ$. Uncertainty on the other shear component, $\\gamma_+$, is about\n1.5 (7) times larger than the $\\gamma_\\times$ uncertainty for targets at\n$i=10^\\circ$ ($50^\\circ$). For arbitrary galaxy position angle on the sky,\nthese forecasts apply not to $\\gamma_+$ and $\\gamma_\\times$ as defined on the\nsky, but to two eigenvectors in $(\\gamma_+, \\gamma_\\times,\\mu)$ space where\n$\\mu$ is the magnification. We also forecast the potential of less expensive\npartial observations of the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We\nconclude by outlining some ways in which real galaxies depart from our\nidealized model and thus create random or systematic uncertainties not captured\nhere. In particular, our forecast $\\gamma_\\times$ precision is currently\nlimited only by the data quality rather than scatter in galaxy properties\nbecause the relevant type of scatter has yet to be measured.\n\n    "

Li and Malkan (2018) used SDSS photometry to find a\npopulation of such starburst galaxies at z~0.5. They were discovered by their\nextremely strong [OIII]4959+5007 emission lines, which produce a clearly\ndetectable excess brightness in the i bandpass, compared with surrounding\nfilters. We therefore used the HST\/COS spectrograph to observe two of the newly\ndiscovered i-band excess galaxies around their Lyman limits. One has strongly\ndetected continuum below its Lyman limit, corresponding to a relative escape\nfraction of ionizing photons of 20+\/-2%. The other, which is less compact in UV\nimaging, has a 2-sigma upper limit to its Lyman escape fraction of <5%. Before\nthe UV spectroscopy, the existing data could not distinguish these two\ngalaxies. Although a sample of two is hardly sufficient for statistical\nanalysis, it shows the possibility that some fraction of these strong [OIII]\nemitters as a class have ionizing photons escaping. The differences might be\ndetermined by the luck of our particular viewing geometry. Obtaining the HST\nspectroscopy, revealed that the Lyman-continuum emitting galaxy differs in\nhaving no central absorption in its prominent Ly{\\alpha} emission line profile.\nThe other target, with no escaping Lyman continuum, shows the more common\ndouble-peaked Ly{\\alpha} emission.\n\n    "

We simulate each assembly history nine times, adopting\ndifferent seeds for the random number generator used by EAGLE's stochastic\nsubgrid implementations of star formation and feedback. The systematic changes\ndriven by differences in assembly history are significantly stronger than the\nrandom scatter induced by this stochasticity. The sensitivity of $\\sim L^\\star$\ngalaxy evolution to dark matter halo assembly follows from the close coupling\nof the growth histories of the central black hole (BH) and the halo, such that\nearlier assembly fosters the formation of a more massive BH, and more efficient\nexpulsion of circumgalactic gas. In response to this expulsion, the\ncircumgalactic medium reconfigures at a lower density, extending its cooling\ntime and thus inhibiting the replenishment of the interstellar medium. Our\nresults indicate that halo assembly history significantly influences the\nevolution of $\\sim L^\\star$ central galaxies, and that the expulsion of\ncircumgalactic gas is a crucial step in quenching them.\n\n    "

Many of these backsplash\nhaloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that\ncarry them well past their initial turnaround radii. Such extreme orbits are\ncreated during the initial accretion and dissolution of loosely bound groups,\nbut also through penetrating encounters between subhaloes on subsequent orbits.\nThe same processes may also give rise to unexpectedly abrupt losses of orbital\nenergy.

These objects were\nfirst classified according to their emission line features into flat-spectrum\nradio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). More recently,\nobservations revealed a trend between these objects known as the \\emph{blazar\nsequence}, along with an anti-correlation between the observed power and the\nfrequency of the synchrotron peak. In the present work, we propose a fairly\nsimple idea that could account for the whole blazar population: all jets are\nlaunched with similar energy per baryon, independently of their power. In the\ncase of FSRQs, the most powerful jets, manage to accelerate to high bulk\nLorentz factors, as observed in the radio. As a result, they have a rather\nmodest magnetization in the emission region, resulting in magnetic reconnection\ninjecting a steep particle energy distribution and, consequently, steep\nemission spectra in the $\\gamma$-rays. For the weaker jets, namely BL Lacs, the\nopposite holds true; i.e., the jet does not achieve a very high bulk Lorentz\nfactor, leading to more magnetic energy available for non-thermal particle\nacceleration, and harder emission spectra at frequencies $\\gtrsim$ GeV. In this\nscenario, we recover all observable properties of blazars with our simulations,\nincluding the \\emph{blazar sequence} for models with mild baryon loading ($50\n\\lesssim \\mu \\lesssim 80$). This interpretation of the blazar population,\ntherefore, tightly constrains the energy per baryon of blazar jets regardless\nof their accretion rate.\n\n    "

In this work, we derive the baryonic\nspecific angular momentum of disc galaxies and study its relation with the dark\nmatter specific angular momentum. Using a combination of high-quality HI\nrotation curves and HI\/near-IR surface densities, we homogeneously measure the\nstellar ($j_{\\rm *}$) and gas ($j_{\\rm gas}$) specific angular momenta for a\nlarge sample of local disc galaxies. This allows us to determine the baryonic\nspecific angular momentum ($j_{\\rm bar}$) with high accuracy and across a very\nwide range of masses. The $j_{\\ast}-M_\\ast$ relation is an unbroken power-law\nfrom $7 \\lesssim$ log($M_\\ast$\/$M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11.5$, with slope $0.54 \\pm\n0.02$. For the gas component, we find that the $j_{\\rm gas}-M_{\\rm gas}$\nrelation is also an unbroken power-law from $6 \\lesssim$ log($M_{\\rm\ngas}$\/$M_\\odot) \\lesssim 11$, with a steeper slope of $1.01 \\pm 0.04$.\nRegarding the baryonic relation, our data support a correlation characterized\nby single power-law with slope $0.58 \\pm 0.02$. Our most massive spirals and\nsmallest dwarfs lie along the same $j_{\\rm bar}-M_{\\rm bar}$ sequence. While\nthe relations are tight and unbroken, we find internal correlations inside\nthem: At fixed $M_\\ast$, galaxies with larger $j_\\ast$ have larger disc scale\nlengths, and at fixed $M_{\\rm bar}$, gas-poor galaxies have lower $j_{\\rm bar}$\nthan expected. We estimate the retained fraction of baryonic specific angular\nmomentum, finding it constant across our entire mass range with a value of 0.7,\nindicating that the $j_{\\rm bar}$ of present-day disc galaxies is comparable to\nthe initial specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes.

However, IRAS17020+4544 is less massive\nand has a much more modest active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity than the\nother examples. Using recent CO(1-0) observations with the NOrthern Extended\nMillimeter Array (NOEMA), we characterised the molecular gas content of the\nhost galaxy for the first time. We found that the molecular gas is distributed\ninto an apparent central disc of 1.1x10^9 Msun, and a northern extension\nlocated up to 8 kpc from the centre with a molecular gas mass M_H2~10^8 Msun.\nThe molecular gas mass and the CO dynamics in the northern extension reveal\nthat IRAS 17020+4544 is not a standard spiral galaxy, instead it is interacting\nwith a dwarf object corresponding to the northern extension. This interaction\npossibly triggers the high accretion rate onto the super massive black hole.\nWithin the main galaxy, which hosts the AGN, a simple analytical model predicts\nthat the molecular gas may lie in a ring, with less molecular gas in the\nnuclear region. Such distribution may be the result of the AGN activity which\nremoves or photodissociates the molecular gas in the nuclear region (AGN\nfeedback). Finally, we have detected a molecular outflow of mass\nM_H2=(0.7-1.2)x10^7 Msun in projection at the location of the northern galaxy,\nwith a similar velocity to that of the massive outflow reported in previous\nmillimeter data obtained by the Large Millimeter Telescope.\n\n    "

In these contexts, the\ngoal of laboratory and numerical studies is to determine the relation between\nthe internal temperature gradients and the heat flux transported by the\nturbulent flow. This is the constitutive law of turbulent convection, to be\ninput into large-scale models of such natural flows. However, in contrast with\nthe radiative heating of natural flows, laboratory experiments have focused on\nconvection driven by heating and cooling plates: the heat transport is then\nseverely restricted by boundary layers near the plates, which prevents the\nrealization of the mixing-length scaling-law used in evolution models of\ngeophysical and astrophysical flows. There is therefore an important\ndiscrepancy between the scaling-laws measured in laboratory experiments and\nthose used eg. in stellar evolution models. Here we provide experimental and\nnumerical evidence that radiatively driven convection spontaneously achieves\nthe mixing-length scaling regime, also known as the `ultimate' regime of\nthermal convection. This constitutes the first clear observation of this regime\nof turbulent convection. Our study therefore bridges the gap between models of\nnatural flows and laboratory experiments.

Measurements of the typical filament core radius $r_0$ from the\nsimulation are consistent with that of isothermal cylinders in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. Such an analytic model also predicts a redshift evolution for the\ncore radius of filaments in fair agreement with the measured value for DM $(r_0\n\\propto (1+z)^{-3.18\\pm 0.28})$. Gas filament cores grow as $(r_0 \\propto\n(1+z)^{-2.72\\pm 0.26})$.

In order to probe different components of the Galactic halo, we have\napplied the Gaussian Mixture Models method to a selected sample of metal poor\nstars with [Fe\/H] $< -0.7$ dex in the APOGEE DR16 catalogue based on\nfour-parameters, metallicity, [Mg\/Fe] ratio and spatial velocity\n(\\textit{$V_R$, $V_\\phi$}). Nine groups are identified with four from the halo\n(group 1, 3, 4 and 5), one from the thick disk (group 6), one from the thin\ndisk (group 8) and one from dwarf galaxies (group 7) by analyzing their\ndistributions in the ([M\/H], [Mg\/Fe]), ($V_R$, $V_\\phi$), (\\textit{Zmax},\n\\textit{eccentricity}), (\\textit{Energy}, \\textit{Lz}) and ([Mg\/Mn], [Al\/Fe])\ncoordinates. The rest two groups are respectively caused by observational\neffect (group 9) and the cross section component (group 2) between the thin\ndisk and the thick disk. It is found that in the extremely outer accreted halo\n(group 1), stars born in the Milky Way can not be distinguished from those\naccreted from other galaxies either chemically or kinematically. In the\nintermediate metallicity of $-$1.6 $<$ [Fe\/H] $< -0.7$ dex, the accreted halo\nmainly composed of the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage substructure (group 5), which can\nbe easily distinguished from group 4 (the in-situ halo group) in both chemical\nand kinematic space. Some stars of group 4 may come from the disk and some disk\nstars can be scattered to high orbits by resonant effects as shown in the\n\\textit{Zmax} versus Energy coordinate. We also displayed the spatial\ndistribution of main components of the halo and the ratio of accreted\ncomponents do not show clear relation to Galactic radius.\n\n    "

      "abstract": "\nAbstract:  Even though the original Kepler mission ended due to mechanical failures, the\nKepler satellite continues to collect data. Using classification models, we can\nunderstand the features exoplanets possess and then use those features to\ninvestigate further for any more information on the candidate planet. Based on\nthe classification model, the idea is to find out the probability of the planet\nunder observation being a candidate for an exoplanet or a false positive. If\nthe model predicts that the observation is a candidate for being an exoplanet,\nthen the further investigation can be conducted. From the model, we can narrow\ndown the features that might explain the difference between a candidate and a\nfalse-positive which ultimately helps us to increase the efficiency of any\nmodel and fine-tune the model and ultimately the process of searching for any\nfuture exoplanets. The model comparison is supported by McNemar's test for\nchecking significance.\n\n    "

We then\nuse this to infer a mean $A_{V}=3.62$ mag, demonstrating the highly-obscured\nnature of these galaxies, with the consequence of increasing our estimates of\nblack-hole masses by an 0.5 orders of magnitude in the most extreme and\nobscured cases.\n\n    "

      "abstract": "\nAbstract:  We present evidence that a magnetic flux rope was formed before a coronal\nmass ejection (CME) and its associated long-duration flare during a pair of\npreceding confined eruptions and associated impulsive flares in a compound\nevent in NOAA Active Region 12371. Extreme-ultraviolet images and the\nextrapolated nonlinear force-free field show that the first two, impulsive\nflares, SOL2015-06-21T01:42, result from the confined eruption of highly\nsheared low-lying flux, presumably a seed flux rope. The eruption spawns a\nvertical current sheet, where magnetic reconnection creates flare ribbons and\nloops, a nonthermal microwave source, and a sigmoidal hot channel which can\nonly be interpreted as a magnetic flux rope. Until the subsequent long-duration\nflare, SOL2015-06-21T02:36, the sigmoid's elbows expand, while its center\nremains stationary, suggesting non-equilibrium but not yet instability. The\n\"flare reconnection\" during the confined eruptions acts like \"tether-cutting\nreconnection\" whose flux feeding of the rope leads to instability. The\nsubsequent full eruption is seen as an accelerated rise of the entire hot\nchannel, seamlessly evolving into the fast halo CME. Both the confined and\nejective eruptions are consistent with the onset of the torus instability in\nthe dipped decay index profile which results from the region's two-scale\nmagnetic structure. We suggest that the formation or enhancement of a\nnon-equilibrium but stable flux rope by confined eruptions is a generic process\noccurring prior to many CMEs.\n\n    "
