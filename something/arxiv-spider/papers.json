      "abstract":"Hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), where the thermal pressure gradient balances\nthe force of gravity, is tested across a range of simulated EAGLE haloes from\nMilky Way L* haloes (M_200~10^12 Msol) to cluster scales. Clusters\n(M_200>=10^14 Msol) reproduce previous results with thermal pressure\nresponsible for ~90% of the support against gravity, but this fraction drops\nfor group-sized haloes (M_200~10^13 Msol) and is even lower (40-70%) for L*\nhaloes between 0.1-0.3 R_200. Energy from feedback grows relative to the\nbinding energy of a halo toward lower mass resulting in greater deviations from\nHSE. Tangential motions comprise the largest deviation from HSE in L* haloes\nindicating that the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) has significant sub-\ncentrifugal rotation and angular momentum spin parameters 2-3x higher than the\ndark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly rise to the outer\nCGM of M_200<10^12 Msol haloes, both moving baryons beyond R_200 and feeding\nuncorrelated tangential motions. The resulting hot halo density and rotation\nprofiles show promising agreement with X-ray observations of the inner Milky\nWay halo, and we discuss future observational prospects to detect spinning hot\nhaloes around other galaxies. Acceleration and radial streaming motions also\ncomprise significant deviations from HSE, especially net outward accelerations\nseen in L* and group haloes indicating active feedback. Black hole feedback\nacts in a preventative manner during the later growth of group haloes, applying\nsignificant accelerations via shocks that do not feed tangential motions. We\nargue that HSE is a poor assumption for the CGM, especially in the inner\nregions, and rotating baryonic hot haloes are a critical consideration for\nanalytic models of the CGM.\n"

It is not clear which of these channels is dominant;\nobservations and light curve modeling have provided evidence for both. Here we\nuse an extensive grid of 4500 time-dependent, multiwavelength radiation\ntransport simulations to show that the sub-$M_{ch}$ model can reproduce the\nentirety of the width-luminosity relation (WLR), while the $M_{ch}$ model can\nonly produce the brighter events $(0.8 < \\Delta M_{15}(B) < 1.55)$, implying\nthat fast-declining SNe Ia come from sub-$M_{ch}$ explosions. We do not assume\na particular theoretical paradigm for the progenitor or explosion mechanism,\nbut instead construct parameterized models that vary the mass, kinetic energy,\nand compositional structure of the ejecta, thereby realizing a broad range of\npossible outcomes of white dwarf explosions. We provide fitting functions based\non our large grid of detailed simulations that map observable properties of SNe\nIa such as peak brightness and light curve width to physical parameters such as\n$^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ and total ejected mass.

For both\nisolated galaxies and paired galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN) are\nselected using emission-line ratios and H_alpha equivalent widths measured\ninside apertures at a fixed physical size. We find AGNs in ~24% of the paired\ngalaxies and binary AGNs in ~13% of the pairs.

      "abstract":"Significant observational effort has been devoted to determining volumetric\ntype Ia supernova rates at high redshifts, leading to clues about the nature of\nIa supernova progenitors and constraints on the iron production in the\nuniverse. A complementary approach is to investigate type Ia supernova rates in\nindividual, more nearby, galaxies. The popular A+B model for the specific\nsupernova rate, while reliable for a wide range of galaxy properties, diverges\nfor large specific star formation rates. Applying it outside its range of\nvalidity could lead to the prediction of excessive type Ia supernova rates.\nMoreover, the A+B model it is not directly derived from a delay time\ndistribution. We here introduce a new model which is explicitly motivated by a\nsimple delay time distribution composed of a prompt and a delayed component.\nThe model is in remarkably good agreement with current observational\nconstraints. It yields a prompt fraction of $f_{p}= 0.11^{+0.10}_{-0.06}$ in\nagreement with results based on volumetric rates of type Ia supernovae at high\nredshift (Rodney et al. 2014). The model is tested against realistic star\nformation rates from the Illustris-1 simulation and is found to be self\nconsistent in the asymptotic limits. An analytic function that encapsulates the\nfeatures of the new model is shown to be in excellent agreement with the data.\nIn terms of goodness of fit, the new model is strongly preferred over the A+B\nmodel. At $\\log{({\\rm sSFR})} \\gtrsim -9$ there are no constraints from\nobservations. Observations in this regime will further constrain the delay time\ndistribution of type Ia supernovae at short delay times.\n"

Its\nlocation, in the core of the massive globular cluster 47 Tuc, hints at a\ndynamical origin. We assess the stability of mass transfer from a carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarf onto compact objects of various masses, and conclude that for mass\ntransfer to proceed stably the accretor must, in fact, be a black hole. Such\nsystems can form dynamically by the collision of a stellar-mass black hole with\na giant star. Tidal dissipation of energy in the giant's envelope leads to a\nbound binary with a pericentre separation less than the radius of the giant. An\nepisode of common-envelope evolution follows, which ejects the giant's\nenvelope. We find that the most likely target is a horizontal-branch star, and\nthat a realistic quantity of subsequent dynamical hardening is required for the\nresulting binary to merge via gravitational wave emission. Observing one binary\nlike 47 Tuc X9 in the Milky Way globular cluster system is consistent with the\nexpected formation rate.

      "abstract":"Super-massive black holes, with masses larger than a million times that of\nthe Sun, appear to inhabit the centers of all massive galaxies.\nCosmologically-motivated theories of galaxy formation need feedback from these\nsuper-massive black holes to regulate star formation. In the absence of such\nfeedback, state-of-the-art numerical simulations dramatically fail to reproduce\nthe number density and properties of massive galaxies in the local Universe.\nHowever, there is no observational evidence of this strongly coupled\nco-evolution between super-massive black holes and star formation, impeding our\nunderstanding of baryonic processes within galaxies. Here we show that the star\nformation histories (SFHs) of nearby massive galaxies, as measured from their\nintegrated optical spectra, depend on the mass of the central super-massive\nblack hole. Our results suggest that black hole mass growth scales with gas\ncooling rate in the early Universe. The subsequent quenching of star formation\ntakes place earlier and more efficiently in galaxies hosting more massive\ncentral black holes. The observed relation between black hole mass and star\nformation efficiency applies to all generations of stars formed throughout a\ngalaxy's life, revealing a continuous interplay between black hole activity and\nbaryon cooling.\n"

From\nthese 20 sources, we analyze the apparent speeds of 43 jet components that are\nall detected at four or more epochs. As has been found for other TeV HBLs, the\napparent speeds of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of\nthe components have an apparent speed that is consistent (within two-sigma)\nwith no motion; and some of these components may be stationary patterns whose\napparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition,\na superluminal tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is\ndetected for the first time, with eight components in seven sources having a\ntwo-sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We combine the data\nfrom these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to\nanalyze the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have\nbeen studied with VLBI at multiple epochs. The highest two-sigma apparent speed\nlower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This suggests that bulk Lorentz\nfactors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the\nparsec-scale radio emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates\nobtained in the radio by other means such as brightness temperatures. This can\nbe reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated from the high-energy data\nif the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions\nwith different Lorentz factors.

In this work, we have constructed photoionization models to\nreproduce the optical and infrared observations of the PN PB 8 using a non-LTE\nstellar model atmosphere ionizing source. A chemically homogeneous model\ninitially used cannot predict the optical recombination lines (ORLs). However,\na bi-abundance model provides a better fit to most of the observed ORLs from N\nand O ions. The metal-rich inclusions in the bi-abundance model occupy 5.6\npercent of the total volume of the nebula, and are roughly 1.7 times cooler and\ndenser than the mean values of the surrounding nebula. The N\/H and O\/H\nabundance ratios in the metal-rich inclusions are ~ 1.0 and 1.7 dex larger than\nthe diffuse warm nebula, respectively. To reproduce the Spitzer spectral energy\ndistribution of PB 8, dust grains with a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01 (by mass)\nwere also included. It is found that the presence of metal-rich inclusions can\nexplain the heavy element ORLs, while a dual-dust chemistry with different\ngrain species and discrete grain sizes likely produces the infrared continuum\nof this PN. This study demonstrates that the bi-abundance hypothesis, which was\nexamined in a few PNe with large abundance discrepancies (ADFs > 10), could\nalso be applied to those typical PNe with moderate abundance discrepancies.\n"

We focus on the entering, and\nprovide a simple formalism for estimating upper limits on mass and energy\ncapture, the latter of which determines maximum mass loss rates. Our approach\nquantifies a competition between two effects: a sufficiently strong planetary\nmagnetic field deflects incoming plasma, but also increases the mass loading\ncross section when the wind and planetary fields are oriented for magnetic\nreconnection. The rate of mass loading can be larger for a magnetized versus an\nunmagnetized planet even if the rate of energy loading is correspondingly less.\nWe find this to be the case for Earth's history since the lunar forming\nimpact-- the likely start of the geodynamo. However, polar focusing can\nincrease the local energy flux beyond that without a magnetosphere for a strong\nenough planetary field and weak enough wind, and we find that this may be the\ncase for Earth's future. The future protective role of Earth's magnetic field\nwould then depend on its ability to trap outgoing plasma. Generally, the\ncompetition between increased collection area and reduced inflow speed from a\nmagnetosphere is likely essential in determining the net protective role of\nplanetary fields and its importance in sustaining habitability.

The\norigin of this phenomenon is debated, and its evolution with redshift is poorly\nconstrained. The observed GALEX FUV-NUV color can be used to probe the UV\nupturn approximately to redshift 0.5. AIMS: We provide constraints on the\nexistence of the UV upturn up to redshift $\\sim$ 0.4 in the brightest cluster\ngalaxies (BCG) located behind the Virgo cluster, using data from the GUViCS\nsurvey. METHODS:We estimate the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observed\nmagnitudes for BCGs from the maxBCG catalog in the GUViCS fields. We increase\nthe number of nonlocal galaxies identified as BCGs with GALEX photometry from a\nfew tens of galaxies to 166 (64 when restricting this sample to relatively\nsmall error bars). We also estimate a central color within a 20 arcsec\naperture. By using the $r$-band luminosity from the maxBCG catalog, we can\nseparate blue FUV-NUV due to recent star formation and candidate upturn cases.\nWe use Lick indices to verify their similarity to redshift 0 upturn cases.\nRESULTS: We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift\nrange 0.10-0.35, vastly improving the existing constraints at these epochs by\nincreasing the number of galaxies studied, and by exploring a redshift range\nwith no previous data (beyond 0.2), spanning one more Gyr in the past. These\ngalaxies bring new constraints that can help distinguish between assumptions\nconcerning the stellar populations causing the UV upturn phenomenon. The\nexistence of a large number of UV upturns around redshift 0.25 favors the\nexistence of a binary channel among the sources proposed in the literature.\n"

Fractionation during magma-ocean freezing leads\nto unstable stratification within the related cumulate layers due to\nprogressive iron enrichment upward, but the effects of incremental cumulate\noverturns during MO crystallization remain to be explored. Here, we use\ngeodynamic models with a moving-boundary approach to study convection and\nmixing within the growing cumulate layer, and thereafter within the fully\ncrystallized mantle. For fractional crystallization, cumulates are efficiently\nstirred due to subsequent incremental overturns, except for strongly\niron-enriched late-stage cumulates, which persist as a stably stratified layer\nat the base of the mantle for billions of years. Less extreme crystallization\nscenarios can lead to somewhat more subtle stratification. In any case, the\nlong-term preservation of at least a thin layer of extremely enriched cumulates\nwith Fe#>0.4, as predicted by all our models, is inconsistent with seismic\nconstraints. Based on scaling relationships, however, we infer that final-stage\nFe-rich magma-ocean cumulates originally formed near the surface should have\noverturned as small diapirs, and hence undergone melting and reaction with the\nhost rock during sinking. The resulting moderately iron-enriched\nmetasomatized\/hybrid rock assemblages should have accumulated at the base of\nthe mantle, potentially fed an intermittent basal magma ocean, and be preserved\nthrough the present-day. Such moderately iron-enriched rock assemblages can\nreconcile the physical properties of the large low shear-wave velocity\nprovinces in the presentday lower mantle.

To\nenhance the contrast of the AIA images, noise adaptive fuzzy equalization is\nemployed, which allows us to identify and quantify counter-streaming flows in\nthe filament. We detect counter-streaming flows in the filament, which are\nvisible in the time-lapse movies in all examined AIA wavelength bands. In the\ntime-lapse movies we see that these persistent flows lasted for at least two\nhours. Furthermore, by applying LCT to the images we clearly determine\ncounter-streaming flows in time series of 171 and 193\\AA\\ images. In the\n304\\AA\\ wavelength band, we only see minor indications for counter-streaming\nflows with LCT, while in the 211\\AA\\ wavelength band the counter-streaming\nflows are not detectable. The average horizontal flows reach mean flow speeds\nof 0.5 km\/s. The highest horizontal flow speeds are identified in the 171\\AA\\\nband with flow speeds of up to 2.5 km\/s. The results are averaged over a time\nseries of 90 min. Because the LCT sampling window has finite width, a spatial\ndegradation cannot be avoided leading to lower estimates of the flow velocities\nas compared to feature tracking or Doppler measurements. The counter-streaming\nflows cover about 15-20% of the whole area of the EUV filament channel and are\nlocated in the central part of the spine.

This first investigation confirms the suitability of A stars in\nthis role. Our work is based on spectroscopy of $\\sim$ 1300\nphotometrically-selected stars in the red calcium-triplet region, chosen to\nmitigate against the effects of interstellar extinction. The stars are located\nin two low Galactic latitude sightlines, at longitudes $\\ell = 118^{\\circ}$,\nsampling strong Galactic rotation shear, and $\\ell = 178^{\\circ}$, near the\nAnticentre. With the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter fitting, stellar\nparameters and radial velocities are measured, and distances computed. The\nobtained trend of radial velocity with distance is inconsistent with existing\nflat or slowly rising rotation laws from gas tracers (Brand & Blitz 1993; Reid\net al. 2014). Instead, our results fit in with those obtained by Huang et al.\n(2016) from disc clump giants that favoured rising circular speeds. An\nalternative interpretation in terms of spiral arm perturbation is not straight\nforward. We assess the role that undetected binaries in the sample and distance\nerror may have in introducing bias, and show that the former is a minor factor.\nThe random errors in our trend of circular velocity are within $\\pm 5$ km\ns$^{-1}$.\n"

As the metallicity\nof the atmosphere is increased we find significant changes in the dynamical and\nthermal structure, with subsequent implications for the simulated phase curve.\nThe trends that we find are qualitatively consistent with previous works,\nthough with quantitative differences. We investigate in detail the effect of\nincreasing the metallicity by splitting the mechanism into constituents,\ninvolving the mean molecular weight, the heat capacity and the opacities. We\nfind the opacity effect to be the dominant mechanism in altering the\ncirculation and thermal structure. This result highlights the importance of\naccurately computing the opacities and radiative transfer in 3D GCMs.\n"

      "abstract":"It has long been recognized that the finite speed of light can affect the\nobserved time of an event. For example, as a source moves radially toward or\naway from an observer, the path length and therefore the light travel time to\nthe observer decreases or increases, causing the event to appear earlier or\nlater than otherwise expected, respectively. This light travel time effect\n(LTTE) has been applied to transits and eclipses for a variety of purposes,\nincluding studies of eclipse timing variations (ETVs) and transit timing\nvariations (TTVs) that reveal the presence of additional bodies in the system.\nHere we highlight another non-relativistic effect on eclipse or transit times\narising from the finite speed of light---caused by an asymmetry in the\ntransverse velocity of the two eclipsing objects, relative to the observer.\nThis asymmetry can be due to a non-unity mass ratio or to the presence of\nexternal barycentric motion. Although usually constant, this barycentric and\nasymmetric transverse velocities (BATV) effect can vary between sequential\neclipses if either the path length between the two objects or the barycentric\ntransverse velocity varies in time. We discuss this BATV effect and estimate\nits magnitude for both time-dependent and time-independent cases. For the\ntime-dependent cases, we consider binaries that experience a change in orbital\ninclination, eccentric systems with and without apsidal motion, and\nhierarchical triple systems. We also consider the time-independent case which,\nby affecting the primary and secondary eclipses differently, can influence the\ninferred system parameters, such as the orbital eccentricity.\n"

In determining the\ndynamics and energetics of the radio sources over cosmic time, a key question\nconcerns what happens when their jets switch off. The resulting `remnant'\nradio-loud AGN have been surprisingly evasive in past radio surveys, and\ntherefore statistical information on the population of radio-loud AGN in their\ndying phase is limited. In this paper, with the recent developments of LOFAR\nand the VLA, we are able to provide a systematically selected sample of remnant\nradio-loud AGN in the Herschel-ATLAS field. Using a simple core-detection\nmethod, we constrain the upper limit on the fraction of remnants in our\nradio-loud AGN sample to 9 per cent, implying that the extended lobe emission\nfades rapidly once the core\/jets turn off. We also find that our remnant sample\nhas a wide range of spectral indices ($-1.5\\leqslant\n\\alpha^{1400}_{150}\\leqslant -0.5$), confirming that the lobes of some remnants\nmay possess flat spectra at low frequencies just as active sources do.

These geometrical tools therefore play\na role which is complementary to that of traditional N-point correlation\nfunctions. Using Shapefinders we study the morphology of neutral hydrogen (HI)\ndensity fields, simulated using semi-numerical technique (inside-out), at\nvarious stages of reionization. Accompanying the Shapefinders, we also employ\nthe 'largest cluster statistic' (LCS), originally proposed in Klypin and\nShandarin (1993), to study the percolation in both neutral and ionized\nhydrogen. We find that the percolation transition in the ionized segment takes\nplace below the neutral fraction $x_{HI} \\lesssim 0.728$ (or $z \\lesssim 9$).\nThe study of Shapefinders reveals that the largest ionized region starts to\nbecome highly filamentary with non-trivial topology near the percolation\ntransition. During the percolation transition, the first two Shapefinders -\n'thickness' ($T$) and 'breadth' ($B$) - of the largest ionized region do not\nvary much, while the third Shapefinder - 'length' ($L$) - abruptly increases.\nConsequently, the largest ionized region tends to be highly filamentary and\ntopologically quite complex. The product of the first two Shapefinders,\n$T\\times B$, provides a measure of the 'cross-section' of a filament-like\nionized region. We find that, near percolation, the value of $T\\times B$ for\nthe largest ionized region remains stable at $\\sim 7$ Mpc$^2$ (in comoving\nscale) while its length increases with time. Interestingly all large ionized\nregions have similar cross-sections. However, their length shows a power-law\ndependence on their volume, $L\\propto V^{0.72}$, at the onset of percolation.\n"

      "abstract":"\nAbstract: In this article, we present the effect of a strong magnetic field in the\nburning of a neutron star (NS). We have used relativistic magneto-hydrostatic\n(MHS) conservation equations for studying the PT from nuclear matter (NM) to\nquark matter (QM). We found that the shock-induced phase transition (PT) is\nlikely if the density of the star core is more than three times nuclear\nsaturation ($\\rho_s$) density. We have also obtained that the conversion\nprocess from NS to quark star (QS) is an exothermic process beyond such\ndensities. The burning process at the star center most likely starts as a\ndeflagration process. However, there can be a small density window at lower\ndensities where the process can be a detonation one. However, at such low\ndensities, the NM energy and QM energy are almost equal, and it is unlikely\nthat the PT process would be an exothermic one. At small enough infalling\nmatter velocities the resultant magnetic field of the QS is lower than that of\nthe NS. However, for a higher value of infalling matter velocities, the\nmagnetic field of QM becomes larger. Therefore, depending on the initial\ndensity fluctuation and on whether the PT is a violent one or not the QS could\nbe more magnetic or less magnetic. This can have substantial observational\nsignificance because a strong magnetar can suddenly become less magnetic and\nwould not show common magnetar properties vice-versa. The PT also have a\nconsiderable effect on the magnetic tilt of the star. For smaller velocities\nand densities the magnetic angle are not affected much but for higher infalling\nvelocities tilt of the magnetic change suddenly. Such angular change can have a\nmassive effect on the observation of the magnetars where new observation can be\nrecorded after PT.\n"

Our computations employ a new formulation of the\nQED Compton scattering cross section in strong magnetic fields that is\nphysically correct for treating important spin-dependent effects in the\ncyclotron resonance, thereby producing correct photon spectra. The spectral\ncut-off energies are sensitive to the choices of observer viewing geometry,\nelectron Lorentz factor, and scattering kinematics.

The planet's light echo emission\ncan potentially be discriminated from that of the host star by means of a time\ndelay, Doppler shift, spatial shift, and polarization, each of which can\nimprove the contrast of the planet to the star.

Intrinsic emission mechanisms include fluorescent pumping of\nmultiple molecular hydrogen and neutral oxygen lines by intense LyAlpha and\nLyBeta flare emission, recombination radiation of ionized and photodissociated\nspecies, and atmospheric processes such as terrestrial upper atmosphere airglow\nand near infrared hydroxyl emission. We discuss the feasibility of detecting\nlight echoes and find that under favorable circumstances, echo detection is\npossible.\n"

      "abstract":"We study the temporal and spectral characteristics of SMC X-3 during its 2016\noutburst. To probe accretion onto highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), at the\nEddington limit. We obtained XMM-Newton observations of SMC X-3 and combined\nthem with long-term observations by Swift. We studied the temporal and spectral\nbehavior of the source, and its short- and long-term evolution. We constructed\na simple toy-model to gain insight into the complex emission pattern of SMC\nX-3. We confirm the pulse period of the system, derived by previous works and\nnote that the pulse has a complex, three peaked shape. We find that the pulsed\nemission is dominated by hard photons, while at energies below ~1 keV, the\nemission is virtually non-pulsating. We further find that the shape of the\npulse profile and the short and long-term evolution of the source light-curve\ncan be explained by invoking a combination of a \"fan\" and a \"polar\" beam. Our\nspectroscopic analysis, reveals a two-component emission: a hard power law and\na soft thermal component. We find that the latter produces the bulk of the\nnon-pulsating emission and is most likely the result of reprocessing of the\nprimary hard emission, by optically thick material that partially obscures the\ncentral source. We also detect strong emission lines from highly ionized\nmetals. The strength of the emission lines are strongly phase-depended. The\nenergy and temporal evolution and the shape of the pulse profile and the\nlong-term spectra evolution of the source are consistent with the expected\nemission pattern of the accretion column in the super-critical regime, while\nthe presence of a large reprocessing region is consistent with the analysis of\npreviously studied X-ray pulsars observed at high accretion rates. The presence\nof this region is consistent with recently proposed works that suggest that\nhigh-B NSs occupy a considerable fraction of ULXs.\n"

This is accounted for in\ncosmological studies using a global property of the SN host galaxy, typically\nthe host galaxy stellar mass. However, recent low-redshift studies suggest that\nthis effect manifests itself most strongly when using the local star-formation\nrate (SFR) at the SN location, rather than the global SFR or stellar mass of\nthe host galaxy. At high-redshift, such local SFRs are difficult to determine;\nhere, we show that an equivalent 'local' correction can be made by restricting\nthe SN Ia sample in globally star-forming host galaxies to a low-mass host\ngalaxy subset ($\\le10^{10} M_{\\odot}$). Comparing this sample of SNe Ia (in\nlocally star-forming environments) to those in locally passive host galaxies,\nwe find that SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments are $0.081\\pm0.018$\nmag fainter ($4.5\\sigma$), consistent with the result reported by Rigault et\nal. (2015), but our conclusion is based on a sample ~5 times larger over a\nwider redshift range. This is a larger difference than when splitting the SN Ia\nsample based on global host galaxy SFR or host galaxy stellar mass. This method\ncan be used in ongoing and future high-redshift SN surveys, where local SN Ia\nenvironments are difficult to determine.\n"

      "abstract":"The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSat is the first solar\nscience oriented CubeSat mission flown for the NASA Science Mission\nDirectorate, with the main objective of measuring the solar soft X-ray (SXR)\nflux and a science goal of determining its influence on Earth's ionosphere and\nthermosphere. These observations can also be used to investigate solar\nquiescent, active region, and flare properties. The MinXSS X-ray instruments\nconsist of a spectrometer, called X123, with a nominal 0.15 keV\nfull-width-half-maximum (FWHM) resolution at 5.9 keV and a broadband X-ray\nphotometer, called XP. Both instruments are designed to obtain measurements\nfrom 0.5 - 30 keV at a nominal time cadence of 10 seconds. A description of the\nMinXSS instruments, performance capabilities, and relation to the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 0.1 - 0.8 nm flux are discussed in\nthis article. Early MinXSS results demonstrate the capability to measure\nvariations of the solar spectral SXR flux between 0.8 - 12 keV from at least\nGOES A5 - M5 (5 $\\times$ 10$^{-8}$ - 5 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ W m$^{-2}$) levels\nand infer physical properties (temperature and emission measure) from the\nMinXSS data alone. Moreover, coronal elemental abundances can be inferred,\nspecifically Fe, Ca, Si, Mg, S, Ar, and Ni, when there is sufficiently high\ncount rate at each elemental spectral feature. Additionally, temperature\nresponse curves and emission measure loci demonstrate the MinXSS sensitivity to\nplasma emission at different temperatures. MinXSS observations coupled with\nthose from other solar observatories can help address some of the most\ncompelling questions in solar coronal physics. Finally, simultaneous\nobservations by MinXSS and Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n(RHESSI) can provide the most spectrally complete soft X-ray solar flare photon\nflux measurements to date.\n"

The origin of this short GRB is still under debate, but a plausible\ninterpretation is that it is due to the off-axis emission from a structured\njet. We consider two possibilities. First, since the best-fit spectral model\nfor the main pulse of GRB 170817A is a cutoff power-law with a hard low-energy\nphoton index ($\\alpha =-0.62_{-0.54}^{+0.49} $) between -0.3 and 0.4 s, we\nconsider an off-axis photosphere model. We develop a theory of photosphere\nemission in a structured jet and find that such a model can reproduce a low\nenergy photon index softer than blackbody through enhancing high-latitude\nemission. The model can naturally account for the observed spectrum. The\nbest-fit Lorentz factor along the line of sight is $\\sim 20$, which demands\nthat there is a significant delay between the merger and jet launching.\nAlternatively, we consider that the emission is produced via synchrotron\nradiation in an optically thin region in an expanding jet with decreasing\nmagnetic fields. This model does not require a delay of jet launching but\ndemands a larger bulk Lorentz factor along the line of sight. We perform Markov\nChain Monte Carlo fitting to the data within the framework of both models and\nobtain good fitting results in both cases.

      "abstract":"Despite the huge amount of photometric and spectroscopic efforts targetting\nthe Galactic bulge over the past few years, its age distribution remains\ncontroversial owing to both the complexity of determining the age of individual\nstars and the difficult observing conditions. Taking advantage of the recent\nrelease of very deep, proper-motion-cleaned colour--magnitude diagrams (CMDs)\nof four low reddening windows obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),\nwe used the CMD-fitting technique to calculate the star formation history (SFH)\nof the bulge at -2deg > b > -4deg along the minor axis. We find that over 80%\nof the stars formed before 8 Gyr ago, but that a significant fraction of the\nsuper-solar metallicity stars are younger than this age. Considering only the\nstars that are within reach of the current generation of spectrographs (i.e. V\n< 21), we find that 11% of the bulge stars are younger than 5 Gyr, while this\nfraction rises to 30-40% in the metal-rich peak. The age-metallicity relation\nis well parametrized by a linear fit implying an enrichment rate of dZ\/dt ~\n0.007 Gyr$^{-1}$. Our metallicity distribution function accurately reproduces\nthat observed by several spectroscopic surveys of Baade's window, with the bulk\nof stars having metal-content in the range [Fe\/H] ~ -0.7 to ~0.6, along with a\nsparse tail to much lower metallicities.\n"

      "abstract":"The galactic environment has been suspected to influence planetary\nhabitability in many ways. Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those\nlargely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to\nform habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system is\nsubjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth\ncluster. Various potential hazards remain after clusters disperse. For\ninstance, central galactic regions may present risks to habitability via nearby\nsupernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition,\nplanets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the\nGalaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the\nbinary's eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we\nreview the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary\nhabitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky\nplanets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars\nwith a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star\nclusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely\nlong-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs,\nand comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more\nlimited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance\nthe threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but\nthe probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability will always\nbe substantially below 100% for any environment. While some Milky Way regions\nmust be more hospitable to habitable planets than others, it is difficult to\nstate that habitable planets are confined to any well-defined region of the\nGalaxy or that any other particular region of the Galaxy is uninhabitable.\n"

Although small, this effect might be useful for\nstar spot studies, and it is particularly significant for a future polarimetric\natmosphere characterization of exoplanets orbiting active host stars. Using\nmodels for a center-to-limb variation of the intensity and polarization in\npresence of continuum scattering and adopting a simplified two-temperature\nphotosphere model, we aim to estimate the intrinsic linear polarization for\nlate-type stars of different gravity, effective temperature, and spottedness.\nWe developed a code that simulates various spot configurations or uses\narbitrary surface maps, performs numerical disk integration, and builds Stokes\nparameter phase curves for a star over a rotation period for a selected\nwavelength. It allows estimating minimum and maximum polarization values for a\ngiven set of stellar parameters and spot coverages.

Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to\nperform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations,\nfree from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free\ninference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the\nobserved data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of\ndimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of\nsummary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive optimal data\ncompression to reduce the dimensionality of the data-space to just one number\nper parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic\nchoice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we introduce density estimation\nlikelihood-free inference, which learns a parameterized model for joint\ndistribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and\nthe model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning\nthan traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free\ninference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer\nforward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and\nBayesian model comparison simultaneously.

      "abstract":"Abridged. Are all filaments bundles of fibers? To address this question, we\nhave investigated the gas organization within the paradigmatic Integral Shape\nFilament (ISF). We combined two new ALMA Cycle 3 mosaics with previous IRAM 30m\nobservations to produce a high-dynamic range N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) emission map of\nthe ISF tracing its high-density material and velocity structure down to scales\nof 0.009 pc. From the analysis of the gas kinematics, we identify a total of 55\ndense fibers in the central region of the ISF. Independently of their location,\nthese fibers are characterized by transonic internal motions, lengths of ~0.15\npc, and masses per-unit-length close to those expected in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. The ISF fibers are spatially organized forming a dense bundle with\nmultiple hub-like associations likely shaped by the local gravitational\npotential. Within this complex network, the ISF fibers show a compact radial\nemission profile with a median FWHM of 0.035 pc systematically narrower than\nthe previously proposed universal 0.1 pc filament width. Our ALMA observations\nreveal complex bundles of fibers in the ISF, suggesting strong similarities\nbetween the internal substructure of this massive filament and previously\nstudied lower-mass objects. The fibers show identical dynamic properties in\nboth low- and high-mass regions, and their widespread detection suggests a\npreferred organizational mechanism of gas in which the physical fiber\ndimensions (width and length) are self-regulated depending on their intrinsic\ngas density. Combined with previous works, we identify a systematic increase of\nthe surface density of fibers as a function of the total mass per-unit-length\nin filamentary clouds. Based on this empirical correlation, we propose a\nunified star-formation scenario where the observed differences between low- and\nhigh-mass clouds emerge naturally from the initial concentration of fibers.\n"

      "abstract":"Strong gravitational lenses with measured time delay are a powerful tool to\nmeasure cosmological parameters, especially the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Recent\nstudies show that by combining just three multiply-imaged AGN systems, one can\ndetermine $H_0$ to 3.8% precision. Furthermore, the number of time-delay lens\nsystems is growing rapidly, enabling, in principle, the determination of $H_0$\nto 1% precision in the near future. However, as the precision increases it is\nimportant to ensure that systematic errors and biases remain subdominant. For\nthis purpose, challenges with simulated datasets are a key component in this\nprocess. Following the experience of the past challenge on time delay, where it\nwas shown that time delays can indeed be measured precisely and accurately at\nthe sub-percent level, we now present the \"Time Delay Lens Modeling Challenge\"\n(TDLMC). The goal of this challenge is to assess the present capabilities of\nlens modeling codes and assumptions and test the level of accuracy of inferred\ncosmological parameters given realistic mock datasets. We invite scientists to\nmodel a set of simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 50 mock\nlens systems. The systems are organized in rungs, with the complexity and\nrealism increasing going up the ladder. The goal of the challenge is to infer\n$H_0$ for each rung, given the HST images, the time delay, and a stellar\nvelocity dispersion of the deflector, for a fixed background cosmology. The\nTDLMC challenge will start with the mock data release on 2018 January 8th, with\na deadline for blind submission of 2018 August 8th. This first paper gives an\noverview of the challenge including the data design, and a set of metrics to\nquantify the modeling performance and challenge details. After the deadline,\nthe results of the challenge will be presented in a companion paper with all\nchallenge participants as co-authors.\n"

      "abstract":"We advocate the idea that the nanoflares conjectured by Parker long ago to\nresolve the corona heating problem, may also trigger the larger solar flares.\nThe arguments are based on the model where emission of extreme ultra violet\n(EUV) radiation and soft x-rays from the Sun are powered externally by incident\ndark matter particles within the Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) Dark Matter Model.\nThe corresponding annihilation events of the AQNs with the solar material are\nidentified with nanoflares. This model gives a very reasonable intensity of EUV\nradiation without adjustments of any parameters in the model. When the same\nnuggets enter the regions with high magnetic field they serve as the triggers\nigniting the magnetic reconnections which eventually may lead to much larger\nflares. Technically, the magnetic reconnection is ignited due to the shock wave\nwhich inevitably develops when the dark matter nuggets enter the solar\natmosphere with velocity $v\\sim 10^{-3}c$ which is much higher than the speed\nof sound $c_s$, such that the Mach number $M=v\/c_s\\gg 1$. These shock waves\ngenerate very strong and very short impulses expressed in terms of pressure\n$\\Delta p\/p\\sim M^2$ and temperature $\\Delta T\/T\\sim M^2$ in vicinity of (would\nbe) magnetic reconnection area. We find that this mechanism is consistent with\nx -ray observations as well as with observed jet like morphology of the initial\nstage of the flares. The mechanism is also consistent with the observed scaling\nof the flare distribution $dN\\sim W^{-\\alpha}dW$ as a function of the flare's\nenergy $W$.

Recent studies focus\non the highly optically-thick limit relevant to the densest ultra-luminous\ngalaxies and super star clusters, where reprocessed infrared photons provide\nthe dominant source of electromagnetic momentum. However, even among starburst\ngalaxies, the great majority instead lie in the so-called \"single-scattering\"\nlimit, where the system is optically-thick to the incident starlight, but\noptically-thin to the re-radiated infrared. In this paper we present a\nstability analysis and multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations\nexploring the stability and dynamics of isothermal dusty gas columns in this\nregime. We describe our algorithm for full angle-dependent radiation transport\nbased on the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method.

We also analysed other archival\nobservations with the source in the field of view to study its long-term\nvariability.\nWith the good position localisation capability of XMM-Newton, we identify the\ncounterpart of the source as MQS J004241.66--734041.3, an AGN behind the SMC at\na redshift of 0.95. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power law\nwith a photon-index of $\\Gamma=1.7$ which is consistent with that expected from\nAGNs. By comparing the current XMM-Newton, observation with an archival\nXMM-Newton and two other ASCA observations of the source, we find signatures of\nlong-term variability which is also a common phenomenon in AGNs. All of the\nabove are consistent with AX J0043-737 being an AGN behind the SMC.\n"

These high pressures (unbalanced\nby the surrounding environment) and a correlation between pressure and incident\nFUV field (G0) seem to indicate a dynamical origin with the radiation field\nplaying an important role in driving the dynamics. We investigate whether\nphotoevaporation of the illuminated edge of a molecular cloud could explain\nthese high pressures and pressure-UV field correlation.

We find that\nphotoevaporation can produce high thermal pressures and the observed P-G0\ncorrelation, almost independently from the initial gas density. In addition, we\nfind that constant-pressure PDR models are a better approximation to the\nstructure of photoevaporating PDRs than constant-density PDR models, although\nmoderate pressure gradients are present. Strong density gradients from the\nmolecular to the neutral atomic region are found, which naturally explain the\nlarge density contrasts (1-2 orders of magnitude) derived from observations of\ndifferent tracers. The photoevaporating PDR is preceded by a low velocity shock\n(a few km\/s) propagating into the molecular cloud. Photoevaporating PDR models\noffer a promising explanation to the recent observational evidence of dynamical\neffects in PDRs.\n"

This solar\noccultation enabled Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) and the\nVisual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) to obtain simultaneous\nmeasurements of the plume's gas and dust components along the same lines of\nsight. The UVIS measurements of the plume's gas content are described in Hansen\net al.

Together, the VIMS\nand UVIS measurements reveal that the plume material above Baghdad and Damascus\nsulci has a dust-to-gas mass ratio that is roughly an order of magnitude higher\nthan the material above Alexandria and Cairo sulci. Similar trends in the\nplume's dust-to-gas ratio are also found in data obtained when Cassini flew\nthrough the plume in 2009, during which time the Ion and Neutral Mass\nSpectrometer (INMS), Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument (RPWS) and Cosmic\nDust Analyzer (CDA) instruments made in-situ measurements of the plume's gas\nand dust densities (Dong et al. 2015 JGR 120:915-937).

      "abstract":"An interplay of magnetic fields and gravitation drives accretion and outflows\nnear black holes. However, a specific mechanism is still a matter of debate; it\nis very likely that different processes dominate under various conditions. In\nparticular, for the acceleration of particles and their collimation in jets, an\nordered component of the magnetic field seems to be essential. Here we discuss\nthe role of large-scale magnetic fields in transporting the charged particles\nand dust grains from the bound orbits in the equatorial plane of a rotating\n(Kerr) black hole and the resulting acceleration along trajectories escaping\nthe system in a direction parallel to the symmetry axis (perpendicular to the\naccretion disk). We consider a specific scenario of destabilization of circular\ngeodesics of initially neutral matter by charging (e.g., due to\nphotoionization). Some particles may set on escaping trajectories and attain\nrelativistic velocity. The case of charged particles differs from charged dust\ngrains by their charge-to-mass ratio, but the acceleration mechanism operates\nin a similar manner. It appears that the chaotic dynamics controls the outflow\nand supports the formation of near-horizon escape zones. We employ the\ntechnique of recurrence plots to characterize the onset of chaos in the\noutflowing medium. We investigate the system numerically and construct the\nbasin-boundary plots, which show the location and the extent of the escape\nzones. The effects of black hole spin and magnetic field strength on the\nformation and location of escape zones are discussed and the maximal escape\nvelocity is computed.\n"

The neighbouring haloes are\nonly superficially enriched, and the metallicity of the clouds is [Fe\/H] < -5.\nOtherwise, the SN ejecta falls back and recollapses to form enriched cloud,\ni.e. internal enrichment (IE) process takes place. In case that a Pop III star\nexplodes as a core-collapse SNe (CCSNe), MHs undergo IE, and the metallicity in\nthe recollapsing region is -5 < [Fe\/H] < -3 in most cases. We conclude that IE\nfrom a single CCSN can explain the formation of EMP stars.

With the state-of-the-art Meudon PDR code, we\nsuccessfully derive the physical conditions, which include the thermal pressure\n($P$) and the scaling factor of radiation fields ($G_{\\mathrm{UV}}$), from the\nobserved CO spectral line energy distributions~(SLEDs) in the observed region.\nThe derived $G_{\\mathrm{UV}}$ values generally show an excellent agreement with\nthe UV radiation fields created by nearby OB-stars and thus confirm that the\nmain excitation source of the observed CO emission are the UV-photons provided\nby the massive stars. The derived thermal pressure is between\n$0.5-3\\,\\times\\,10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{K\\,cm^{-3}}$ with the highest values found\nalong the ionization front in Car I-E region facing Trumpler 14, hinting that\nthe cloud structure is similar to the recent observations of the Orion Bar.\nComparing the derived thermal pressure with the radiation fields, we report the\nfirst observationally-derived and spatially-resolved $P \\sim\n2\\times10^4\\,G_{\\mathrm{UV}}$ relationship. As direct comparisons of the\nmodeling results to the observed $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}$, [OI] $63\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$,\nand [CII] $158\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ intensities are not straightforward, we urge\nthe readers to be cautious when constraining the physical conditions of PDRs\nwith combinations of $^{12}\\mathrm{CO}$, $^{13}\\mathrm{CO}$, [CI], [OI]\n$63\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, and [CII] $158\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ observations.\n"

Most CO emission appears clumpy in N55, and molecular cores that have\nYSOs show larger linewidths and masses. The massive clumps are associated with\nhigh and intermediate mass YSOs. The clump masses are determined by local\nthermodynamic equilibrium and virial analysis of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO\nemissions. These mass estimates lead to the conclusion that, (a) the clumps are\nin self-gravitational virial equilibrium, and (b) the $^{12}$CO(1-0)-to-H$_2$\nconversion factor, X$_{\\rm CO}$, is 6.5$\\times$10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$(K km\ns$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. This CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor for N55 clumps is measured\nat a spatial scale of $\\sim$0.67 pc, which is about two times higher than the\nX$_{\\rm CO}$ value of Orion cloud at a similar spatial scale. The core mass\nfunction of N55 clearly show a turnover below 200M$_{\\odot}$, separating the\nlow-mass end from the high-mass end. The low-mass end of the $^{12}$CO mass\nspectrum is fitted with a power law of index 0.5$\\pm$0.1, while for $^{13}$CO\nit is fitted with a power law index 0.6$\\pm$0.2.

This, however, makes the latter appealing for balloon and\nspace observations from above (most of) the Earth's atmosphere. We estimate the\nresidual effect of the O$_2$ band on the K I $D_2$ line at altitudes typical\nfor stratospheric balloons. Our aim is to study the feasibility of observing\nthe 770 nm window. Specifically, this paper serves as a preparation for the\nthird flight of the Sunrise balloon-borne observatory. The results indicate\nthat the absorption by O$_2$ is still present, albeit much weaker, at the\nexpected balloon altitude. We applied the obtained O$_2$ transmittance to K I\n$D_2$ synthetic polarimetric spectra and found that in the absence of\nline-of-sight motions, the residual O$_2$ has a negligible effect on the K I\n$D_2$ line. On the other hand, for Doppler-shifted K I $D_2$ data, the residual\nO$_2$ might alter the shape of the Stokes profiles. However, the residual O$_2$\nabsorption is sufficiently weak at stratospheric levels that it can be divided\nout if appropriate measurements are made, something that is impossible at\nground level. Therefore, for the first time with Sunrise III, we will be able\nto perform polarimetric observations of the K I $D_2$ line and, consequently,\nwe will have improved access to the thermodynamics and magnetic properties of\nthe upper photosphere from observations of the K I lines.\n"

      "abstract":"Highly precise pulsar timing is very important for understanding the nature\nof a neutron star, and it can even be used to detect gravitational waves.\nUnfortunately, the accuracy of the pulsar timing is seriously affected by the\nspin-down irregularities of pulsars, such as spin fluctuations with a\nmanifestation of low frequency structures (the so-called red noise processes),\nand various activities of magnetospheres. The physical origins of these noises\nstill remain unexplained. In this Letter, we propose a possible physical\nmechanism that the de Haas-van Alphen magnetic oscillation should trigger the\nobserved low frequency structures in pulsar timing noises. We find that the de\nHaas-van Alphen magnetic oscillation period is about 1-$10^{2}$ yr, which is\nabout $10^{-4}$ times as long as the classical characteristic time scale of the\ninterior magnetic field evolution for a normal neutron star. Due to the de\nHaas-van Alphen magnetic oscillation, we estimate that the braking index can be\nbetween $10^{-5}$ and $10^{5}$, the range of residuals is between 10 ms to 820\nms for some quasi-periodic pulsars. Those are consistent with the pulsar timing\nobservations.\n"

      "abstract":"Context. Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to derive\naccurate cosmological distances through empirical standardization techniques.\nDespite this success neither the progenitors of SNe Ia nor the explosion\nprocess are fully understood. The U-band region has been less well observed for\nnearby SNe, due to technical challenges, but is the most readily accessible\nband for high-redshift SNe.\nAims. Using spectrophotometry from the Nearby Supernova Factory, we study the\norigin and extent of U-band spectroscopic variations in SNe Ia and explore\nconsequences for their standardization and the potential for providing new\ninsights into the explosion process.\nMethods. We divide the U-band spectrum into four wavelength regions\n{\\lambda}(uNi), {\\lambda}(uTi), {\\lambda}(uSi) and {\\lambda}(uCa). Two of these\nspan the Ca H&K {\\lambda}{\\lambda} 3934, 3969 complex. We employ spectral\nsynthesis using SYNAPPS to associate the two bluer regions with Ni\/Co and Ti.\nResults. (1) The flux of the uTi feature is an extremely sensitive\ntemperature\/luminosity indicator, standardizing the SN peak luminosity to 0.116\n$\\pm$ 0.011 mag RMS. A traditional SALT2.4 fit on the same sample yields a\n0.135 mag RMS. Standardization using uTi also reduces the difference in\ncorrected magnitude between SNe originating from different host galaxy\nenvironments. (2) Early U-band spectra can be used to probe the Ni+Co\ndistribution in the ejecta, thus offering a rare window into the source of\nlightcurve power. (3) The uCa flux further improves standardization, yielding a\n0.086 $\\pm$ 0.010 mag RMS without the need to include an additional intrinsic\ndispersion to reach {\\chi}$^2$\/dof $\\sim$ 1. This reduction in RMS is partially\ndriven by an improved standardization of Shallow Silicon and 91T-like SNe.\n"

      "abstract":"In this work, we have studied the dynamical evolution of the shock front in a\nneutron star. The shock wave is expected to possess enough strength to ignite\nthe nuclear matter thereby converting it to quark matter. The conversion of\nnuclear to quark matter is assumed to take place at the shock discontinuity.\nThe density and pressure discontinuity is studied both spatially and temporally\nas it starts near the center of the star and moves towards the surface.\nPolytropic equations of state which mimics real original nuclear matter and\nquark matter equations of state are used to study such dynamical phase\ntransition. Solving relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a spherically\nsymmetric star we have studied the phase transition assuming a considerable\ndensity discontinuity near the center. We find that as the shock wave\npropagates outwards, its intensity decreases with time, however the shock\nvelocity peaks up and reaches a value close to that of light. Such fast shock\nvelocity indicates rapid phase transition in neutron star taking place on a\ntimescale of some tens of microseconds. Such a result is quite an interesting\none, and it differs from previous calculations that the phase transition in\nneutron stars takes at least some tens of milliseconds. Rapid phase transition\ncan have significant observational significance because such fast phase\ntransition would imply quite strong gravitational wave signals but very short\nlived. Such short-lived gravitational wave signals would be accompanied with\nshort-lived gamma-ray bursts and neutrino signals originating from the neutrino\nand gamma-ray generation from the phase transition of nuclear matter to quark\nmatter.\n"

The pulsars were observed\nwith the Arecibo Observatory and\/or the Green Bank Telescope at frequencies\nranging from 327 MHz to 2.3 GHz. Most pulsars were observed with approximately\nmonthly cadence, with six high--timing-precision pulsars observed weekly, and\nall were observed at widely separated frequencies at each observing epoch in\norder to fit for time-variable dispersion delays. We describe our methods for\ndata processing, time-of-arrival (TOA) calculation, and the implementation of a\nnew, automated method for removing outlier TOAs. We fit a timing model for each\npulsar which includes spin, astrometric, and, if necessary, binary parameters,\nin addition to time-variable dispersion delays and parameters that quantify\npulse-profile evolution with frequency. The new timing solutions provide three\nnew parallax measurements, two new Shapiro-delay measurements, and two new\nmeasurements of large orbital-period variations. We fit models that\ncharacterize sources of noise for each pulsar. We find that 11 pulsars show\nsignificant red noise, with generally smaller spectral indices than typically\nmeasured for non-recycled pulsars, possibly suggesting a different origin.\nFuture papers will use these data to constrain or detect the signatures of\ngravitational-wave signals.\n"

      "abstract":"The various stages of baryonic gamma-ray burst afterglow blast waves are\nreviewed. These are responsible for the afterglow emission from which much of\nour understanding of gamma-ray bursts derives. Initially, the blast waves are\nconfined to the dense medium surrounding the burster (stellar envelope or dense\nwind), giving rise to a jet-cocoon structure. A massive ejecta is released and\npotentially fed by ongoing energy release from the burster and a\nforward-reverse shock system is set up between ejecta and ambient density.\nUltimately the blast wave spreads sideways and slows down, and the dominant\nafterglow emission shifts from X-rays down to radio. Over the past years\nsignificant progress has been made both observationally and\ntheoretically\/numerically in our understanding of these blast waves, unique in\nthe universe due to their often incredibly high initial Lorentz factors of\n100-1000. The recent discovery of a short gamma-ray burst counterpart to a\ngravitational wave detection (GW 170817) brings the promise of a completely new\navenue to explore and constrain the dynamics of gamma-ray burst blast waves.\n"

After about 200 ms from\ncore-collapse, the PNS evolution may be modeled as a sequence of\nquasi-stationary configurations. These configurations depend on the PNS\nthermodynamic profiles, whose evolution largely depends upon the neutrino\ndiffusion. We developed a new PNS evolutionary code that solves by iteration\nthe neutrino number and energy transport equations together with the\nrelativistic stellar structure equations assuming spherical symmetry. The\nneutrino cross sections are determined consistently with the underlying\nequation of state (EoS). To include the EoSs in the evolution, we devised and\ntested a new fitting formula for the interacting part of the baryon\nfree-energy, valid at finite temperature and arbitrary degeneracy. Using our\ncode, we provide estimates for the neutrino signal in the Super-Kamiokande III\ndetector and the frequencies of the gravitational waves due to stellar\noscillations, for three stellar masses and three nucleonic EoSs. For the first\ntime we evolve a PNS with a nuclear many-body theory EoS in a consistent way,\nthat is, we take into account realistic nuclear interactions in the computation\nof the neutrino cross sections. By including rotation in an effective way, we\nhave also determined the time variation of the rotation frequency due to PNS\ncontraction and neutrino angular momentum loss, and the gravitational wave\nsignal due to rotation. We find that the mass shedding limit restricts the\ninitial angular momentum. Consequently, the final rotation frequency has to be\nsmaller than about 300 Hz for a PNS of about 1.6 solar masses whose EoS is\ndescribed by the GM3 mean-field model.\n"

The observed stability of the inner disk of stellar-mass\nblack holes can be used to derive \\emph{direct} constraints on the mass of dark\nphotons in the mass range $ 10^{-13}\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_V \\lesssim 3\\times\n10^{-12}\\,{\\rm eV}$. By including also higher azimuthal modes, similar\nconstraints apply to axion-like particles in the mass range\n$6\\times10^{-13}\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_{\\rm ALP} \\lesssim 10^{-11}\\, {\\rm eV}$.\nLikewise, mass and spin distributions of supermassive BHs --~as measured\nthrough continuum fitting, K$\\alpha$ iron line, or with the future space-based\ngravitational-wave detector LISA~-- imply indirect bounds in the mass range\napproximately $10^{-19}\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_V, m_{\\rm ALP} \\lesssim 10^{-13}\\,\n{\\rm eV}$, for both axion-like particles and dark photons. Overall,\nsuperradiance allows to explore a region of approximately $8$ orders of\nmagnitude in the mass of ultralight bosons.\n"

Numerical simulations are a valuable tool for\nstudying the accretion-disk--magnetosphere interaction that is central to these\nproblems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond\npulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating\naccretion, have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while\nforce-free methods, suitable for such regions, cannot include the accreting\ngas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free,\nhighly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic\nsimulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric\ngeneral-relativistic MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the\ninteraction of a turbulent accretion flow with a pulsar's electromagnetic wind\ncan lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state. This\ntransition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose power\ncan greatly exceed the power of the isolated pulsar's wind. If the accretion\nrate is below a critical value, the pulsar instead expels the accretion stream.\nMore generally, our simulations produce for the first time the four possible\naccretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion rate: (a) crushed\nmagnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled accretion onto\nthe stellar poles; (c) the propeller state, where material enters through the\nlight cylinder but is prevented from accreting by the centrifugal barrier; (d)\nalmost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the light cylinder by the\npulsar wind.\n"

Moreover, we confirm\nthat a higher initial metallicity produces a colder gas and a larger fraction\nof molecular gas, with the low-metallicity simulation best matching the\nobserved molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.

On the other hand, the\nupper bounds on primordial non-Gaussianity obtained by the Planck Collaboration\nare expected to play a significant role on explorations of the LQC\nphenomenology.

      "abstract":"\nAbstract: Non-attractor inflation is known as the only single field inflationary\nscenario that can violate non-Gaussianity consistency relation with the\nBunch-Davies vacuum state and generate large local non-Gaussianity. However, it\nis also known that the non-attractor inflation by itself is incomplete and\nshould be followed by a phase of slow-roll attractor. Moreover, there is a\ntransition process between these two phases. In the past literature, this\ntransition was approximated as instant and the evolution of non-Gaussianity in\nthis phase was not fully studied. In this paper, we follow the detailed\nevolution of the non-Gaussianity through the transition phase into the\nslow-roll attractor phase, considering different types of transition. We find\nthat the transition process has important effect on the size of the local\nnon-Gaussianity. We first compute the net contribution of the non-Gaussianities\nat the end of inflation in canonical non-attractor models. If the curvature\nperturbations keep evolving during the transition - such as in the case of\nsmooth transition or some sharp transition scenarios - the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nlocal non-Gaussianity generated in the non-attractor phase can be completely\nerased by the subsequent evolution, although the consistency relation remains\nviolated. In extremal cases of sharp transition where the super-horizon modes\nfreeze immediately right after the end of the non-attractor phase, the original\nnon-attractor result can be recovered. We also study models with non-canonical\nkinetic terms, and find that the transition can typically contribute a\nsuppression factor in the squeezed bispectrum, but the final local\nnon-Gaussianity can still be made parametrically large.\n"

The reverberation lag resulting from\nthe path length difference between direct and reflected emission provides a\npowerful tool to probe the innermost regions around both stellar-mass and\nsupermassive black holes. Here, we present for the first time a reverberation\nmapping formalism that enables modeling of energy dependent time lags and\nvariability amplitude for a wide range of variability timescales, taking the\ncomplete information of the cross-spectrum into account. We use a pivoting\npower-law model to account for the spectral variability of the continuum that\ndominates over the reverberation lags for longer time scale variability. We use\nan analytic approximation to self-consistently account for the non-linear\neffects caused by this continuum spectral variability, which have been ignored\nby all previous reverberation studies. We find that ignoring these non-linear\neffects can bias measurements of the reverberation lags, particularly at low\nfrequencies. Since our model is analytic, we are able to fit simultaneously for\na wide range of Fourier frequencies without prohibitive computational expense.\nWe also introduce a formalism of fitting to real and imaginary parts of our\ncross-spectrum statistic, which naturally avoids some mistakes\/inaccuracies\npreviously common in the literature. We perform proof-of-principle fits to\nRossi X-ray Timing Explorer data of Cygnus X-1.\n"

Despite the success of\nthe NASA FUSE mission, the use of lithium fluoride (LiF)-based optics is rare,\nas LiF is hygroscopic and requires handling procedures that can drive risk.\nWith NASA now studying two large mission concepts for astronomy, Large\nUV-Optical-IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) and the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission\n(HabEx), which mandate throughput down to 1000 {\\AA}, the development of\nLiF-based coatings becomes crucial.

Discovered in the Reionization Lensing\nCluster Survey (RELICS) Hubble Treasury program and companion S-RELICS Spitzer\nprogram, this candidate has a lensed H-band magnitude of 25.7+\/-0.1 AB mag.\nWith a magnification of \\mu~4-7 estimated from our lens models, the de-lensed\nintrinsic magnitude is 27.6+\/-0.3 AB mag, and the half-light radius is r_e<0.8\nkpc, both consistent with other z>9 candidates. The inferred stellar mass (log\n[M* \/M_Sun]=9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.5}) and star formation rate (\\log [SFR\/M_Sun\nyr^{-1}]=1.3^{+0.2}_{-0.3}) indicate that this candidate is a typical\nstar-forming galaxy on the z>6 SFR-M* relation. We note that three independent\nlens models predict two counterimages, at least one of which should be of a\nsimilar magnitude to the arc, but these counterimages are not yet detected.\nCounterimages would not be expected if the arc were at lower redshift. However,\nthe only spectral energy distributions capable of fitting the Hubble and\nSpitzer photometry well at lower redshifts require unphysical combinations of\nz~2 galaxy properties. The unprecedented lensed size of this z~10 candidate\noffers the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope to study the geometric\nand kinematic properties of a galaxy observed 500 Myr after the Big Bang.\n"

The northernmost\ncomplex of 4C+29.48 contains a blazar with a high brightness temperature\ncompact core and a steep-spectrum jet feature. The blazar is positionally\ncoincident with an optical source at a redshift of 1.142. Its mid-infrared\ncolors also support its association with a gamma-ray emitting blazar. The two\nother radio complexes have steep radio spectra and do not have optical or\ninfrared counterparts in currently available surveys.

More than 20,000\ndust particles from each source moon in the size range from 0.05 micron to 1 cm\nare simulated over 8,000 (Earth) years until each dust grain hits a sink\n(moons, Jupiter, or escape from the system).

For certain small particle sizes, the dust population is\ndisplaced towards the Sun, while for certain larger sizes, the dust population\nis displaced away from the Sun. The average lifetime as a function of particle\nsize for ejecta from each source moon is derived, and two sharp jumps in the\naverage lifetime are analyzed. Transport of dust between the Galilean moons and\nto Jupiter is investigated. Most of the orbits for dust particles from Galilean\nmoons are prograde, while, surprisingly, a small fraction of orbits are found\nto become retrograde mainly due to solar radiation pressure and Lorentz force.\nThe distribution of orbital elements is also analyzed.\n"

      "abstract":"We explore the structure of magnetic field lines in and around filaments in\nsimulations of molecular clouds undergoing global, multi-scale gravitational\ncollapse. In these simulations, filaments are not in a static equilibrium, but\nare long-lived flow structures that accrete gas from their environment and\ndirect it toward clumps embedded in the filament or at the nodes at the\nconjunction with other filaments. In this context, the magnetic field is\ndragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that\ngenerates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and\nthe magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas\ndensity increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to\nthe filament, and magnetic lines also tend to align with it. At the spine of\nthe filament, however, magnetic lines become perpendicular again since they\nmust connect to lines on the opposite side of the filament, resulting in\n\"U\"-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal\nflow along the filament. Magnetic diffusive processes, however, allow the gas\nto continue to flow. Assuming a stationary state in which the ram pressure of\nthe flow balances the magnetic tension, the curvature of the field lines is\ndetermined by the diffusion rate. We derive an expression relating the\ncurvature of the field lines to the diffusive coefficient, which may be used to\nobservationally determine the nature of the diffusive process.\n"

      "abstract":"Most close double helium white dwarfs will merge within a Hubble time due to\norbital decay by gravitational-wave radiation. However, a significant fraction\nwith low mass ratios will survive for a long time as a consequence of stable\nmass transfer. Such stable mass transfer between two helium white dwarfs (HeWD)\nprovides one channel for the production of AM\\,CVn binary stars. In previous\ncalculations of double HeWD progenitors, the accreting HeWD was treated as a\npoint mass. We have computed the evolution of 16 double HeWD models in order to\ninvestigate the consequences of treating the detailed evolution of both\ncomponents. We find that the boundary between binaries having stable and\nunstable mass transfer is slightly modified by this approach. By comparing with\nobserved periods and mass ratios, we redetermine masses of eight known AM\\,CVn\nstars by our double HeWDs channel, i.e. HM\\,Cnc, AM CVn, V406\\,Hya, J0926,\nJ1240, GP\\,Com, Gaia14aae and V396\\,Hya.

The rapid rotation\nleads to the formation of two distinct dynamical regimes which are separated by\na magnetic tangent cylinder - mTC. Outside the mTC there are strong zonal\nflows, where Reynolds stress balances turbulent viscosity, but inside the mTC\nLorentz force reduces the zonal flow. The dynamic interaction between both\nregions induces meridional circulation. We find a rich diversity of magnetic\nfield morphologies. There are Jupiter-like steady dipolar fields, and a belt of\nquadrupolar dominated dynamos spanning the range of models between Jupiter-like\nand Saturn-like conductivity profiles. This diversity may be linked to the\nappearance of reversed sign helicity in the metallic regions of our dynamos.\nWith Saturn-like conductivity profiles we find models with dipolar magnetic\nfields, whose axisymmetric components resemble those of Saturn, and which\noscillate on a very long time-scale.

Black holes seem like mystical objects, but they are\nan integral part of current astrophysics and are at the center of attempts to\nunify quantum physics and general relativity. Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes. In contrast\nto earlier pictures of black holes, that dark feature is not supposed to be due\nto a hole in the accretion flow, but would represent a true negative image of\nthe event horizon. Currently, the global Event Horizon Telescope consortium is\nattempting to make such an image. In the future those images could be improved\nby adding more telescopes to the array, in particular at high sites in Africa.\nUltimately, a space array at THz frequencies, the Event Horizon Imager, could\nproduce much more detailed images of black holes. In combination with numerical\nsimulations and precise measurements of the orbits of stars - ideally also of\npulsars - these images will allow us to study black holes with unprecedented\nprecision.\n"

The bremsstrahlung is generally\nrecognised in the radio and in the UV-X-ray frequency ranges, while dust\nreradiation peaks in the IR. To reproduce the continuum SED of most of the GRB,\nSLSN, SB and AGN in the near-IR-optical range, the contribution of an old star\nbackground population is needed. This radiation can be reproduced by a black\nbody (bb) corresponding to temperatures T_{bb} =3000-8000 K. The best fit of a\nfew host SEDs includes also the direct contribution of the bb flux from the SB\ncorresponding to Ts about 5 10^4K. d\/g calculated by modelling the SEDs of\nobscured GRB hosts roughly increases with z resembling the SFR trend.\n"

Even\nthough these approximations are small individually they could sum up,\nespecially since they include local effects such as the Sachs-Wolfe and\npeculiar motion, but also non-local ones like the Born-approximation and the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. In this work we will address all points\nmentioned and perturbatively calculate the effect on a tomographic cosmic shear\npower spectrum of each effect individually as well as all cross-correlations.\nOur findings show that each effect is at least 4 to 5 orders of magnitude below\nthe leading order lensing signal.

Its updated light curve now includes 5 iterations\nof a main pattern comprising a high peak and a longer trough, with a period P\n\\sim 2.2 yr. Our analysis of 2015-2017 data confirms the occurrence in January\n2017 of a new peak fitting in the previous trend. In addition, we identify\nsecondary peaks (\"twin peaks\") that occur in closely symmetric pairs on both\nsides of most main peaks, including the last one; their occurrence is supported\nby correlated X-ray outbursts. We stress that the above features strongly point\nto binary dynamics in a system of two black holes (BHs) of some 10^8 and 10^7\nM_sun. At periastron the smaller BH periodically stresses the jet j_1 launched\nby the heavier companion, and triggers MHD-kinetic tearing instabilities. These\nlead to magnetic reconnections and to acceleration of electrons that produce\nsynchrotron emission from the optical to X-ray bands, and inverse Compton\nscattering into the GeV range. For the origin of the twin peaks we discuss two\npossibilities: a single-jet model, based on added instabilities induced in j_1\nby the smaller companion BH on its inner orbital arc; and a two-jet model with\nthe smaller BH supporting its own, precessing jet j_2 that contributes lower,\nspecific GeV emissions. Such behaviors combining time stability with amplitude\nvariations betray plasma instabilities driven in either jet by binary dynamics,\nand can provide a double signature of the long-sought supermassive BH binaries.\n"

In this paper, we revisit the\nstrength of this relation using an exhaustive compilation of observational\nresults from the literature on this issue.

The complexity of the observational picture is\nconfirmed by these simulations, which suggest that the vertical-to-radial axis\nratio of the SVE is not a good indicator of the main source of disc heating.\nOur analysis of those simulations also indicates that the observed shape of the\ndisc SVE may be affected by several processes simultaneously and that the\nsignatures of some of them (e.g. mergers) fade over time.\n"

We show that the best way to\nestimate the temperature of emitting gas is to analyze the line peak emission\nmap without subtracting continuum emission. Continuum subtraction, which is\ncommonly applied to observations of line emission, systematically leads to\nunderestimation of the gas temperature. We further show that once observational\neffects such as beam dilution and noise are accounted for, the line brightness\ntemperature derived from the peak emission is reliably within 10-15% of the\nphysical temperature of the emitting region, assuming optically thick emission.\nThe methodology described in this paper will be applied in future works to\nconstrain the temperature, and related physical quantities, in protoplanetary\ndisks observed with ALMA.\n"

The accompanied\nphotospheric vector magnetic field changes are also analyzed using data from\nthe Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. As a result, we found, for a penumbral\nsegment in the negative field adjacent to the magnetic polarity inversion line\n(PIL), an enhancement of penumbral flows (up to an unusually high value of\n\\sm2~\\kms) and extension of penumbral fibrils after the first peak of the flare\nhard X-ray (HXR) emission.

The enhancing\npenumbral and shear flow regions are also accompanied by an increase of\nhorizontal field and decrease of magnetic inclination angle(measured from the\nsolar surface).

SEP propagation is influenced by turbulent\nmagnetic fields in the solar wind, resulting in stochastic transport of SEPs to\nEarth. Multi-spacecraft observations suggest that the cross-field propagation\nshapes the SEP fluxes at Earth strongly. However, modelling SEP cross-field\ntransport as spatial diffusion has been shown to be insufficient without use of\nunrealistically large cross-field diffusion coefficients. Recent work has shown\nthat the early-time propagation of energetic particles across the mean field\ndirection in turbulent fields is not diffusive, as the particles propagating\nalong meandering field lines. This early-time transport mode results in fast\naccess of the particles across the mean field direction, in agreement with the\nSEP observations. In this work, we demonstrate the significance of turbulence\nstrength on evolution of the SEP radiation environment near Earth. We calculate\nthe transport parameters with a turbulence transport model, parametrised by the\nSEP parallel scattering mean free path at 1~AU, $\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{*}$, and\nshow that the parallel and cross-field transport are connected, with conditions\nresulting in slow parallel transport corresponding to wider events.

About two dozen of these stellar tidal\ndisruption flares (TDFs) may have been detected in optical transient surveys.\nHowever, explaining the observed properties of these events within the tidal\ndisruption paradigm is not yet possible. This theoretical ambiguity has led\nsome authors to suggest that optical TDFs are due to a different process, such\nas a nuclear supernova or accretion disk instabilities. Here we present a test\nof a fundamental prediction of the tidal disruption event scenario: a\nsuppression of the flare rate due to the direct capture of stars by the black\nhole. Using a recently compiled sample of candidate TDFs with black hole mass\nmeasurements, plus a careful treatment of selection effects in this\nflux-limited sample, we confirm that the dearth of observed TDFs from high-mass\nblack holes is statistically significant. All the TDF impostor models we\nconsider fail to explain the observed mass function; the only scenario that\nfits the data is a suppression of the rate due to direct captures. We find that\nthis suppression can explain the low volumetric rate of the luminous TDF\ncandidate ASASSN-15lh, thus supporting the hypothesis that this flare belongs\nto the TDF family.

Starting from those obtained for a monochromatic distribution, we\nconvert them into constraints for EMDs by using an equivalent, effective mass\n$M_{\\rm eq}$ that depends on the specific observable. We highlight how limits\nof validity of the PBH modelling affect the EMD parameter space. Finally, we\npresent converted constraints on the total abundance of PBH from microlensing,\nstellar distribution in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and CMB accretion for\nLognormal and Power Law mass distributions, finding that EMD constraints are\ngenerally stronger than monochromatic ones.\n"

They reconfirm the presence of an unexplained\nemission feature which is most prominent in the region of $1-10$ GeV, known as\nthe Galactic Center GeV excess (GCE). Although the GCE is now firmly detected,\nan interpretation of this emission as a signal of self-annihilating dark matter\n(DM) particles is not unambiguously possible due to systematic effects in the\ngamma-ray modeling estimated in the Galactic Plane. In this paper we build a\ncovariance matrix, collecting different systematic uncertainties investigated\nin the Fermi Collaboration's paper that affect the GCE spectrum. We show that\nmodels where part of the GCE is due to annihilating DM can still be consistent\nwith the new data. We also re-evaluate the parameter space regions of the\nminimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) that can contribute dominantly to\nthe GCE via neutralino DM annihilation. All recent constraints from DM direct\ndetection experiments such as PICO, LUX, PandaX and Xenon1T, limits on the\nannihilation cross section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies and Large Hadron\nCollider limits are considered in this analysis. Due to a slight shift in the\nenergy spectrum of the GC excess with respect to the previous Fermi analysis,\nand the recent limits from direct detection experiments, we find a slightly\nshifted parameter region of the MSSM compared to our previous analysis that is\nconsistent with the GCE. Neutralinos with a mass between $85-220$ GeV can\ndescribe the excess via annihilation into a pair of $W$-bosons or top quarks.\nRemarkably, there are low fine-tuning models among the regions that we have\nfound. The complete set of solutions will be probed by upcoming direct\ndetection experiments and with dedicated searches in the upcoming data of the\nLarge Hadron Collider.\n"

Several\nrecent studies have shown that a planet with a mass of about 10 Earth masses on\na distant eccentric orbit with perihelion far beyond the Kuiper belt could\ncreate and maintain this clustering. The evolutionary path resulting in an\norbit such as the one suggested for Planet Nine is nevertheless not easily\nexplained.

Recent simulations of planetesimal formation via the streaming\ninstability suggest that planetesimals can readily form beyond 100au. We\nexplore this circularisation by dynamical friction with a set of numerical\nsimulations. We find that a planet that is scattered from the region close to\nNeptune onto an eccentric orbit has a 20-30% chance of obtaining an orbit\nsimilar to that of Planet Nine after 4.6Gyr. Our simulations also result in\nstrong or partial clustering of the planetesimals; however, whether or not this\nclustering is observable depends on the location of the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal belt.

In this work, we explore the connection between the mass of BHs\nresiding in the brightest group\/cluster galaxies (BGGs\/BCGs) and the virial\ntemperature, and hence total gravitating mass, of galaxy groups\/clusters. To\nthis end, we investigate a sample of 17 BGGs\/BCGs with dynamical BH mass\nmeasurements and utilize XMM-Newton X-ray observations to measure the virial\ntemperatures and infer the $M_{\\rm 500}$ mass of the galaxy groups\/clusters. We\nfind that the $M_{\\rm BH} - kT$ relation is significantly tighter and exhibits\nsmaller scatter than the $M_{\\rm BH} - M_{\\rm bulge}$ relations.

      "abstract":"\nAbstract: The growth of a planetary core by pebble accretion stops at the so called\npebble isolation mass, when the core generates a pressure bump that traps\ndrifting pebbles outside its orbit. If the isolation mass is very small, then\ngas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a\nmainly solid composition. For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the\nplanet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into\na gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation\nmass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here we expand on previous\nmeasurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all\nrelevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling\nlaw that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$. We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas,\nwith Stokes number $\\tau_{\\rm f}<0.005$ can drift through the partial gap at\npebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must\nbe decreasingly smaller to penetrate through the pressure bump. Turbulent\ndiffusion of particles, however, can lead to an increase of the pebble\nisolation mass by a factor of two, depending on the strength of the background\nviscosity and on the pebble size. We finally explore the implications of the\nnew scaling law of the pebble isolation mass on the formation of planetary\nsystems by numerically integrating the growth and migration pathways of planets\nin evolving protoplanetary discs. Compared to models neglecting the dependence\nof the pebble isolation mass on the $\\alpha$-viscosity, our models including\nthis effect result in larger core masses for giant planets. These larger core\nmasses are more akin to the core masses of the giant planets in the Solar\nSystem.\n"

While it is known that in a neutrino-powered CCSN, explosion begins\nwhen the neutrino luminosity of the proto-neutron star exceeds a critical\nvalue, the physics of this condition in time-dependent, multidimensional\nsimulations are not fully understood. \\citet{Pejcha2012} found that an\n`antesonic condition' exists for time-steady spherically symmetric models,\npotentially giving a physical explanation for the critical curve observed in\nsimulations. In this paper, we extend that analysis to more general\ntime-dependent polytropic models. We verify the critical antesonic condition in\nour simulations, showing that models exceeding it drive transonic winds whereas\nmodels below it exhibit steady accretion. In addition, we find that (1) high\nspatial resolution is needed for accurate determination of the antesonic ratio\nand shock radius at the critical curve, and that low resolution simulations\nsystematically underpredict these quantities, making explosion more difficult\nat lower resolution; (2) there is an important physical connection between the\ncritical mass accretion rate at explosion and the mass loss rate of the\npost-explosion wind: the two are directly proportional at criticality, implying\nthat, at criticality, the wind kinetic power is tied directly to the accretion\npower; (3) the value of the post-shock adiabatic index $\\Gamma$ has a large\neffect on the length and time scales of the post-bounce evolution of the\nexplosion larger values of $\\Gamma$ result in a longer transition from the\naccretion to wind phases.\n"

      "abstract":"An understanding of pulsar timing noise offers the potential to improve the\ntiming precision of a large number of pulsars as well as facilitating our\nunderstanding of pulsar magnetospheres. For some sources, timing noise is\nattributable to a pulsar switching between two different spin-down rates\n$(\\dot{\\nu})$. Such transitions may be common but difficult to resolve using\ncurrent techniques. In this work, we use simulations of $\\dot{\\nu}$-variable\npulsars to investigate the likelihood of resolving individual $\\dot{\\nu}$\ntransitions. We inject step-changes in the value of $\\dot{\\nu}$ with a wide\nrange of amplitudes and switching timescales. We then attempt to redetect these\ntransitions using standard pulsar timing techniques. The pulse arrival-time\nprecision and the observing cadence are varied. Limits on $\\dot{\\nu}$\ndetectability based on the effects such transitions have on the timing\nresiduals are derived. With the typical cadences and timing precision of\ncurrent timing programs, we find we are insensitive to a large region of\n$\\Delta \\dot{\\nu}$ parameter space which encompasses small, short timescale\nswitches. We find, where the rotation and emission states are correlated, that\nusing changes to the pulse shape to estimate $\\dot{\\nu}$ transition epochs, can\nimprove detectability in certain scenarios. The effects of cadence on $\\Delta\n\\dot{\\nu}$ detectability are discussed and we make comparisons with a known\npopulation of intermittent and mode-switching pulsars.

To pinpoint the physical parameters, and at the same time to break\nthe parallax degeneracy, we make use of a series of arguments: the $\\chi^2$\nhierarchy, the Rich argument, and a prior Galactic model.

In a principal component analysis of 29 physical\nparameters of 41,338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density of stellar mass\nis found to be the fourth most important parameter.

With ever larger telescopes under design and a growing need to not\njust detect planets but also to characterize them, it is timely to consider\nwhether there is any prospect of remotely detecting exoplanet topography in the\ncoming decades. To test this, we devised a novel yet simple approach to detect\nand quantify topographical features on the surfaces of exoplanets using transit\nlight curves. If a planet rotates as it transits its parent star, its changing\nsilhouette yields a time-varying transit depth, which can be observed as an\napparent and anomalous increase in the photometric scatter. Using elevation\ndata for several rocky bodies in our solar system, we quantify each world's\nsurface integrated relief with a \"bumpiness\" factor, and calculate the\ncorresponding photometric scatter expected during a transit. Here we describe\nthe kinds of observations that would be necessary to detect topography in the\nideal case of Mars transiting a nearby white dwarf star.

      "abstract":"The galactic gaseous halo is a gas reservoir for the interstellar medium in\nthe galaxy disk, supplying materials for star formation. We developed a gaseous\nhalo model connecting the galaxy disk and the gaseous halo by assuming the star\nformation rate on the disk is balanced by the radiative cooling rate of the\ngaseous halo, including stellar feedback. In addition to a single-temperature\ngaseous halo in collisional ionization equilibrium, we also consider the\nphotoionization effect and a steady-state cooling model. Photoionization is\nimportant for modifying the ion distribution in low-mass galaxies and outskirts\nof massive galaxies due to the low densities. The multi-phase cooling model\ndominates the region within the cooling radius, where t_cooling=t_Hubble. Our\nmodel reproduces most of the observed high ionization state ions for a wide\nrange of galaxy masses (i.e., OVI, OVII, NeVIII, MgX, and OVIII). We find that\nthe OVI column density has a narrow range around ~10^14 cm^-2 for halo masses\nfrom M_star ~ 3 * 10^10 Msun to 6*10^12 Msun, which is consistent with some but\nnot all observational studies. For galaxies with halo masses <~ 3 * 10^11 Msun,\nphotoionization produces most of the OVI, while for more massive galaxies, the\nOVI is from the medium that is cooling from higher temperatures. Fitting the\nGalactic (Milky-Way) OVII and OVIII suggests a gaseous halo model where the\nmetallicity is ~0.55 Zsun and the gaseous halo has a maximum temperature of ~\n1.9 * 10^6 K. This gaseous halo model does not close the census of baryonic\nmaterial within R200.\n"

      "abstract":"We study a truncated accretion disk using a well-resolved, semi-global\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation that is evolved for many dynamical times (6096\ninner disk orbits). The spectral properties of hard state black hole binary\nsystems and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei are regularly attributed to\ntruncated accretion disks, but a detailed understanding of the flow dynamics is\nlacking. In these systems the truncation is expected to arise through thermal\ninstability driven by sharp changes in the radiative efficiency. We emulate\nthis behavior using a simple bistable cooling function with efficient and\ninefficient branches. The accretion flow takes on an arrangement where a\n\"transition zone\" exists in between hot gas in the inner most regions and a\ncold, Shakura $\\&$ Sunyaev thin disk at larger radii. The thin disk is embedded\nin an atmosphere of hot gas that is fed by a gentle outflow originating from\nthe transition zone. Despite the presence of hot gas in the inner disk,\naccretion is efficient. Our analysis focuses on the details of the angular\nmomentum transport, energetics, and magnetic field properties. We find that the\nmagnetic dynamo is suppressed in the hot, truncated inner region of the disk\nwhich lowers the effective $\\alpha$-parameter by $65\\%$.\n"

We used HARPS at the ESO 3.6m telescope to monitor the\nradial velocity of HD95086 over 2 years and investigate the existence of giant\nplanets at less than 3au orbital distance. With the IRDIS dual-band imager and\nthe IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE at VLT, we imaged the faint\ncircumstellar environment beyond 10au at six epochs between 2015 and 2017. We\ndo not detect additional giant planets around HD95086. We identified the nature\n(bound companion or background contaminant) of all point-like sources detected\nin the IRDIS field of view. None of them correspond to the ones recently\ndiscovered near the edge of the cold outer belt by ALMA. HD95086b is resolved\nfor the first time in J-band with IFS. Its near-infrared spectral energy\ndistribution is well fitted by a few dusty and\/or young L7-L9 dwarf spectral\ntemplates. The extremely red 1-4um spectral distribution is typical of\nlow-gravity objects at the L\/T spectral type transition. The planet's orbital\nmotion is resolved between January 2015 and May 2017. Together with past NaCo\nmeasurements properly re-calibrated, our orbital fitting solutions favor a\nretrograde low to moderate-eccentricity orbit e=0.2 (0.0 to 0.5), with a\nsemi-major axis 52au corresponding to orbital periods of 288$ yrs and an\ninclination that peaks at i = 141deg, which is compatible with a planet-disk\ncoplanar configuration.

The quiet Sun Mg\/Ne ratio is important for assessing the effect of\nmagnetic activity on the mechanism of the first ionization potential (FIP)\neffect, while the Ne\/O ratio can be used to infer the solar photospheric\nabundance of neon, which can not be measured directly.

Extreme events are of particular interest, not only because of the\nscientific challenges they pose, but also because of their possible societal\nconsequences. Here we present a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the 14\nJuly 2000 Bastille Day eruption, which produced a very strong geomagnetic\nstorm. After constructing a thermodynamic MHD model of the corona and solar\nwind, we insert a magnetically stable flux rope along the polarity inversion\nline of the eruption's source region and initiate the eruption by boundary\nflows. More than 10^33 ergs of magnetic energy are released in the eruption\nwithin a few minutes, driving a flare, an EUV wave, and a coronal mass ejection\n(CME) that travels in the outer corona at about 1500 km\/s, close to the\nobserved speed. We then propagate the CME to Earth, using a heliospheric MHD\ncode. Our simulation thus provides the opportunity to test how well in situ\nobservations of extreme events are matched if the eruption is initiated from a\nstable magnetic-equilibrium state. We find that the flux-rope center is very\nsimilar in character to the observed magnetic cloud, but arrives about 8.5\nhours later and about 15 degrees too far to the North, with field strengths\nthat are too weak by a factor of about 1.6. The front of the flux rope is\nhighly distorted, exhibiting localized magnetic-field concentrations as it\npasses 1 AU.

The eruption coincided\nwith the appearance of two series of jets, with velocities comparable to the\nAlfv\\'en speeds in their footpoints. Several pieces of evidence of magnetic\nbraiding in the eruption are revealed, including localized bright knots,\nmultiple well-separated jet threads, transition region explosive events and the\nfact that all these three are falling into the same locations within the\neruptive structures. Through analysis of the extrapolated three-dimensional\nmagnetic field in the region, we found that the eruptive spiral structure\ncorresponded well to locations of twisted magnetic flux tubes with varying curl\nvalues along their lengths. The eruption occurred where strong parallel\ncurrents, high squashing factors, and large twist numbers were obtained. The\nelectron number density of the eruptive structure is found to be\n$\\sim3\\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, indicating that significant amount of mass\ncould be pumped into the corona by the jets. Following the eruption, the\nextrapolations revealed a set of seemingly relaxed loops, which were visible in\nthe AIA 94 \\AA\\ channel indicating temperatures of around 6.3 MK. With these\nobservations, we suggest that magnetic braiding could be part of the mechanisms\nexplaining the formation of solar eruption and the mass and energy supplement\nto the corona.\n"

In\na search for all the isotopologues, we identified transitions of\n$^{13}$CH$_3$OH. The physical conditions were derived considering collisional\nand radiative processes. We found common temperatures for each $A$ and $E$\nsymmetry of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN; the derived column densities indicate an\n$A\/E$ equilibrated ratio for both tracers.

Despite the fact that VW Cephei is one of the well-studied contact\nbinaries in the literature, there is no fully consistent model available that\ncan explain every observed property of this system.\nAims. Our motivation is to obtain new spectra along with photometric\nmeasurements, to analyze what kind of changes may have happened in the system\nin the past two decades, and to propose new ideas for explaining them.\nMethods. For the period analysis we determined 10 new times of minima from\nour light curves, and constructed a new O$-$C diagram of the system. Radial\nvelocities of the components were determined using the cross-correlation\ntechnique. The light curves and radial velocities were modelled simultaneously\nwith the PHOEBE code. All observed spectra were compared to synthetic spectra\nand equivalent widths of the H$\\alpha$ line were measured on their differences.\nResults. We have re-determined the physical parameters of the system\naccording to our new light curve and spectral models. We confirm that the\nprimary component is more active than the secondary, and there is a correlation\nbetween spottedness and the chromospheric activity. We propose that flip-flop\nphenomenon occurring on the primary component could be a possible explanation\nof the observed nature of the activity. To explain the period variation of VW\nCep, we test two previously suggested scenarios: presence of a fourth body in\nthe system, and the Applegate-mechanism caused by periodic magnetic activity.\nWe conclude that although none of these mechanisms can be ruled out entirely,\nthe available data suggest that mass transfer with a slowly decreasing rate\ngives the most likely explanation for the period variation of VW Cep.\n"

      "abstract":"The joint detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from\nthe binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 has provided unprecedented\ninsight into a wide range of physical processes: heavy element synthesis via\nthe $r$-process; the production of relativistic ejecta; the equation of state\nof neutron stars and the nature of the merger remnant; the binary coalescence\ntimescale; and a measurement of the Hubble constant via the \"standard siren\"\ntechnique. In detail, all of these results depend on the distance to the host\ngalaxy of the merger event, NGC4993. In this paper we measure the surface\nbrightness fluctuation (SBF) distance to NGC4993 in the F110W and F160W\npassbands of the Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared Channel on the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST). For the preferred F110W passband we derive a distance modulus\nof $m{-}M=33.05\\pm0.08\\pm0.10$ mag, or a linear distance $d=40.7\\pm1.4\\pm1.9$\nMpc (random and systematic errors, respectively); a virtually identical result\nis obtained from the F160W data. This is the most precise distance to NGC4993\navailable to date. Combining our distance measurement with the corrected\nrecession velocity of NGC4993 implies a Hubble constant $H_0=71.9\\pm 7.1$\n\\kmsmpc. A comparison of our result to the GW-inferred value of $H_0$ indicates\na binary orbital inclination of $i\\,{\\gtrsim}\\,137~\\deg$. The SBF technique can\nbe applied to early-type host galaxies of BNS mergers to ${\\sim\\,}100$ Mpc with\nHST and possibly as far as ${\\sim\\,}300$ Mpc with the James Webb Space\nTelescope, thereby helping to break the inherent distance-inclination\ndegeneracy of the GW signals at distances where many future BNS mergers are\nlikely to be detected.\n"

We consider how astrophysical processes are altered in the absence\nof weak forces, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), galaxy formation,\nmolecular cloud assembly, star formation, and stellar evolution. Without weak\ninteractions, neutrons no longer decay, and the universe emerges from its early\nepochs with a mixture of protons, neutrons, deuterium, and helium. The\nbaryon-to-photon ratio must be smaller than the canonical value in our universe\nto allow free nucleons to survive the BBN epoch without being incorporated into\nheavier nuclei. At later times, the free neutrons readily combine with protons\nto make deuterium in sufficiently dense parts of the interstellar medium, and\nprovide a power source before they are incorporated into stars. Almost all of\nthe neutrons are incorporated into deuterium nuclei before stars are formed. As\na result, stellar evolution proceeds primarily through strong interactions,\nwith deuterium first burning into helium, and then helium fusing into carbon.\nLow-mass deuterium-burning stars can be long-lived, and higher mass stars can\nsynthesize the heavier elements necessary for life.

Our\nmodeling confirms that the method can be widely used for Type-1 AGNs when\nviewing inclinations are between 25 and 45 degrees.

Our models show that\nif Keplerian motion can be traced through the polarized line profile, then the\ndirect estimation of the mass of the SMBH can be performed.

We use wavelet decomposition to distinguish between noise, continuum\ntrends, and stellar spectral features in the CORALIE spectra.

For a sample of G and K type hosts, most of these planets\nwill be between 25 and 50 milli-arcsec (mas) from their host star and 1 billion\nto 10 billion times fainter. To separate the planet's image from that of its\nhost star at the wavelength (763nm) of the oxygen biosignature we need a\ntelescope with an aperture of 16 metres. Furthermore, the intensity of the\nlight from the host star at the position in the image of the exoplanet must be\nsuppressed otherwise the exoplanet will be lost in the glare.\nThis presents huge technical challenges. The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent\nwhich makes it impossible to achieve the required contrast from the ground at\n763nm. The telescope therefore needs to be in space and to fit the telescope in\nthe rocket fairing it must be a factor of 4 or more times smaller when folded\nthan when operational. To obtain spectroscopy of the planet's biosignature at\n763nm we need to use an integral field spectrometer (IFS) with a field of view\n(FOV) of 1000 x 1000 milli-arcsec (mas) and a spectral resolution of 100. This\nis a device that simultaneously takes many pictures of the exoplanet each at a\nslightly different wavelength which are then recorded as a data cube with two\nspatial dimensions and one wavelength dimension. In every data cube wavelength\nslice, the background light from the host star at the location of the planet\nimage must be minimised. This is achieved via a coronagraph which blocks the\nlight from the host star and active\/adaptive optics techniques which\ncontinuously maintain very high accuracy optical alignment to make the images\nas sharp as possible.

      "abstract":"\nAbstract: This is the first paper of a series dedicated to nebular physics and the\nchemical evolution of nearby galaxies by investigating large samples of HII\nregions with the CFHT imaging spectrograph SITELLE. We present a technique\nadapted to imaging spectroscopy to identify and extract parameters from 4285\nHII region candidates found in the disc of NGC628. Using both the spatial and\nspectral capabilities of SITELLE, our technique enables the extraction of the\nposition, dust extinction, velocity, Halpha profile, diffuse ionised gas (DIG)\nbackground, luminosity, size, morphological type, and the emission line fluxes\nfor individual spaxels and the integrated spectrum for each region. We have\nproduced a well-sampled HII region luminosity function and studied its\nvariation with galactocentric radius and level of the DIG background. We found\na slope of 1.12+\/-0.03 with no evidence of a break at high luminosity. Based on\nthe width of the region profile, bright regions are rather compact, while faint\nregions are seen over a wide range of sizes. The radius function reveals a\nslope of 1.81+\/-0.02. BPT diagrams of the individual spaxels and integrated\nline ratios confirm that most detections are HII regions. Also, maps of the\nline ratios show complex variations of the ionisation conditions within HII\nregions. All this information is compiled in a new catalogue for HII regions.\nThe objective of this database is to provide a complete sample which will be\nused to study the whole parameter space covered by the physical conditions in\nactive star-forming regions.\n"

By\nrelaxing the common assumption that the DM halo scale radius is tied to that of\nthe luminous stellar component and by marginalizing on the unknown stellar\nvelocity dispersion anisotropy, we prove that observations lead to rather weak\nconstraints on the DM mass, that could be as low as tens of eV. In this\nscenario, however, the DM halos would be quite large and massive, so that a\nbound stems from the requirement that the time of orbital decay due to\ndynamical friction in the hosting Milky Way DM halo is longer than their\nlifetime. The smallest and nearest satellites Segue I and Willman I lead to a\nfinal lower bound of $m\\gtrsim100$ eV, still weaker than previous estimates but\nrobust and independent on the model of DM formation and decoupling. We thus\nshow that phase space constraints do not rule out the possibility of sub-keV\nfermionic DM.\n"

      "abstract":"\nAbstract: Interstellar gas clouds are often both highly magnetized and supersonically\nturbulent, with velocity dispersions set by a competition between driving and\ndissipation. This balance has been studied extensively in the context of gases\nwith constant mean density. However, many astrophysical systems are contracting\nunder the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between\ndriving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that\nresembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some\ncircumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a\nrate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized\ngas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,\nmagnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than\nwould be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case. We\nuse the simulation results to construct an analytic model that gives an\neffective equation of state for a coarse-grained parcel of the gas, in the form\nof an ideal equation of state with a polytropic index that depends on the\ndissipation and energy transfer rates between the magnetic and turbulent\ncomponents. We argue that the reduced dissipation rate and larger equilibrium\nvelocity dispersion produced by compressing, magnetized turbulence has\nimportant implications for the driving and maintenance of turbulence in\nmolecular clouds, and for the rates of chemical and radiative processes that\nare sensitive to shocks and dissipation.\n"

In two flare\nregions the sources of the HXR pulsations were located at footpoints of\ndifferent magnetic field lines wrapping around the central axis, and\nconstituting an MFR by themselves. In five other flares the parent field lines\nof the HXR pulsations were not a part of an MFR, but surrounded it in the form\nof an arcade of magnetic loops. Also, we found that in three out of seven\nevents the sources of the HXR pulsations were located in vicinity of enhanced\n($\\gtrsim 10^{4}$~statampere~cm$^{-2}$) regions of VECs on the photosphere,\nhaving the form of extended ribbons elongated ($\\gtrsim 10$~Mm) mainly along an\nMPIL.

We also consider a\nGaussian nucleation rate, which gives a more precise result for the bubble size\ndistribution. We discuss the implications for the computation of cosmic\nremnants.\n"

The viable regions of the parameter space,\nthat can also account for the relic density and evade the current searches, are\nidentified, if the low-velocity dark matter annihilates through an $s$-channel\noff-shell mediator mostly into $\\bar{b} b$, and\/or annihilates directly into\ntwo ${\\it hidden}$ on-shell mediators, which subsequently decay into the quark\npairs. These two kinds of annihilations are $s$ wave. The projected monojet\nlimit set by the high luminosity LHC sensitivity could constrain the favored\nparameter space, where the mediator's mass is larger than the dark matter mass\nby a factor of 2. We show that the projected sensitivity of 15-year Fermi-LAT\nobservations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies can provide a stringent constraint on\nthe most parameter space allowed in this model. If the on-shell mediator\nchannel contributes to the dark matter annihilation cross sections over 50$\\%$,\nthis model with a lighter mediator can be probed in the projected PICO-500L\nexperiment.\n"

      "abstract":"\nAbstract: We discuss inflation models within supersymmetry and supergravity frameworks\nwhich possess an axionic landscape and a shift symmetry which is broken by\nnon-perturbative symmetry breaking terms in the superpotential. The proposed\nmodels constitute consistent inflation for the following reasons: The inflation\npotential arises dynamically with stabilized saxions, the axion decay constant\ncan lie in the sub-Planckian region, and consistency with the Planck data is\nachieved. The axion landscape consisting of $m$ axion pairs is assumed with the\naxions in each pair having opposite charges. A fast roll--slow roll splitting\nmechanism for the axion potential is proposed which is realized with a special\nchoice of the axion basis. In this basis the $2m$ coupled equations split into\n$2m-1$ equations which enter in the fast roll and there is one unique linear\ncombination of the $2m$ fields which controls the slow roll and thus the power\nspectrum of curvature and tensor perturbations. It is shown that a significant\npart of the parameter space exists where inflation is successful, i.e., $N_{\\rm\npivot} = {[50, 60]}$, the spectral index $n_s$ of curvature perturbations, and\nthe ratio $r$ of the power spectrum of tensor perturbations and curvature\nperturbations, lie in the experimentally allowed regions given by the Planck\nexperiment. Further, it is shown that the model allows for a significant region\nof the parameter space where the effective axion decay constant can lie in the\nsub-Planckian domain. An analysis of the tensor spectral index $n_t$ is also\ngiven and the future experimental data which constraints $n_t$ will further\nnarrow down the parameter space of the proposed inflationary models.\n"

      "abstract":"\nAbstract: We use the observed abundances of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in clusters\nand groups and \\Lambda CDM subhalo mass functions to put constraints on the\ndistribution {of present-day halo masses of satellite} UDGs. If all of the most\nmassive subhaloes in the cluster host a UDG, UDGs occupy all subhaloes with\n\\log M_{sub}\/M_\\odot\\gtrsim11. For a model in which the efficiency of UDG\nformation is higher around some characteristic halo mass, higher fractions of\nmassive UDGs require larger spreads in the UDG mass distribution. In a cluster\nwith a virial mass of 10^{15}M_\\odot, the 90% upper limit for the fraction of\nUDGs with \\log M_{sub}\/M_\\odot>12 is 7%, occupying 70% of all cluster subhaloes\nabove the same mass. To reproduce the observed abundances, however, the mass\ndistribution of satellite UDGs has to be broad, with >30% having \\log\nM_{sub}\/M_\\odot<10.9. This strongly supports that UDGs are part of a continuous\ndistribution in which a majority are hosted by low mass haloes. The abundance\nof satellite UDGs may fall short of the linear relation with the cluster\/group\nmass M_{host} in low-mass hosts, \\log M_{host}\/M_\\odot\\sim 12.

This result is of\nfundamental importance for understanding the emission process and requires\nextended studies over a wider frequency range. In this paper we have carried\nout a detailed study of the profile component widths of 123 normal pulsars\nobserved in the Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric Emission Survey at\n333 and 618 MHz. The components in the pulse profile were separated into core\nand conal classes. We found that at both frequencies the core as well as the\nconal component widths versus period had a LBL which followed the $P^{-0.5}$\nrelation with a similar lower boundary. The radio emission in normal pulsars\nhave been observationally shown to arise from a narrow range of heights around\na few hundred kilometers above the stellar surface. In the past the $P^{-0.5}$\nrelation has been considered as evidence for emission arising from last open\ndipolar magnetic field lines. We show that the $P^{-0.5}$ dependence only holds\nif the trailing and leading half-power points of the component are associated\nwith the last open field line. In such a scenario we do not find any physical\nmotivation which can explain the $P^{-0.5}$ dependence for both core and conal\ncomponents as evidence for dipolar geometry in normal pulsars.
